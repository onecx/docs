# Review and Customize API Mappings

After generating a Backend for Frontend (BFF) project, the next step is to review the generated API mappings and controller implementation.

The OneCX BFF Generator creates an initial project structure based on the provided frontend and backend OpenAPI specifications. The generated code provides a starting point for connecting the frontend-facing API with the backend service API.

| |  The generated BFF implementation is a scaffold. It should be reviewed and adapted before being used as production-ready code. |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## [](#purpose-of-this-step)Purpose of this Step

The BFF generator analyzes two OpenAPI specifications:

Frontend OpenAPI

Defines the API exposed by the generated BFF to the frontend application.

Backend OpenAPI

Defines the backend API consumed by the generated BFF.

Based on these specifications, the generator creates controller and mapper classes that help connect both API contracts.

The generated code usually needs to be reviewed in the following areas:

* controller implementation
* frontend-to-backend request mapping
* backend-to-frontend response mapping
* error handling
* response status handling
* generated mapper methods
* generated tests
* OpenAPI operation alignment

## [](#generated-controller-implementation)Generated Controller Implementation

Generated controllers are located under the generated BFF package, for example:

```text
src/main/java/org/tkit/onecx/demo/bff/rs/controllers/
```

A generated controller usually contains:

* injected backend REST client
* injected mapper
* generated endpoint methods
* backend call delegation
* response handling
* exception mapping support

Example generated controller location

```text
src/main/java/org/tkit/onecx/demo/bff/rs/controllers/ProductsRestController.java
```

## [](#action-review-generated-controllers)ACTION: Review Generated Controllers

After generation, review each generated controller and verify:

* whether the correct backend client method is called
* whether path parameters are passed correctly
* whether request bodies are mapped correctly
* whether response bodies are mapped correctly
* whether HTTP status codes are handled as expected
* whether additional business logic is required

Example areas to check:

```java
Response backendResponse = client.searchProducts(...);
```

```java
return Response
        .status(backendResponse.getStatus())
        .entity(mapper.map(result))
        .build();
```

| |  Generated controller methods may require manual adjustments when the frontend API and backend API do not match one-to-one. |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## [](#api-mapping-review)API Mapping Review

The BFF layer is responsible for adapting backend APIs to frontend needs.

This may include:

* renaming fields
* transforming request objects
* transforming response objects
* combining multiple backend calls
* filtering backend data
* enriching responses
* changing response structures
* handling frontend-specific validation

## [](#mapper-classes)Mapper Classes

Generated mapper classes are located under:

```text
src/main/java/<base-package>/rs/mappers/
```

Example:

```text
src/main/java/org/tkit/onecx/demo/bff/rs/mappers/ProductMapper.java
```

Mapper classes are typically generated to convert:

* frontend request DTOs to backend request models
* backend response models to frontend response DTOs
* backend entities to frontend DTOs
* frontend DTOs to backend entities where required

## [](#action-review-generated-mappers)ACTION: Review Generated Mappers

Review generated mapper methods and verify that the mappings match the expected API contract.

Example generated mapper method:

```java
@BeanMapping(ignoreByDefault = true)
BackendProduct map(ProductDTO source);
```

Depending on your use case, you may need to:

* add explicit field mappings
* rename mapped fields
* ignore fields
* map nested objects
* map enum values
* add custom mapping methods

Example with explicit MapStruct mapping:

```java
@Mapping(target = "productName", source = "name")
@Mapping(target = "productPrice", source = "price")
BackendProduct map(ProductDTO source);
```

| |  Generated mapper methods are intentionally minimal. Add explicit mappings where frontend and backend models differ. |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## [](#request-mapping)Request Mapping

When the frontend API defines request objects that differ from backend request objects, the generated mapper should convert between both models.

Example:

```java
BackendSearchCriteria criteria = mapper.map(searchProductRequestDTO);
Response backendResponse = client.searchProducts(criteria);
```

## [](#action-verify-request-mapping)ACTION: Verify Request Mapping

Check whether:

* all required backend fields are populated
* optional frontend fields are handled correctly
* default values are set where required
* search and filter criteria are mapped correctly
* pagination information is passed correctly

## [](#response-mapping)Response Mapping

The BFF should return frontend-oriented response models. Backend response structures may differ and often require mapping.

Example:

```java
BackendProduct result = backendResponse.readEntity(BackendProduct.class);
return Response
        .status(backendResponse.getStatus())
        .entity(mapper.map(result))
        .build();
```

## [](#action-verify-response-mapping)ACTION: Verify Response Mapping

Check whether:

* backend model fields are correctly exposed to the frontend
* internal backend fields are not leaked
* nested objects are mapped correctly
* lists and paginated responses are handled correctly
* empty responses and error responses are handled correctly

## [](#error-handling)Error Handling

Generated controllers may include exception mapper support.

Typical generated exception mapper classes are located under:

```text
src/main/java/<base-package>/rs/mappers/
```

Example:

```text
ExceptionMapper.java
```

## [](#action-review-error-handling)ACTION: Review Error Handling

Verify that:

* backend errors are mapped to frontend-compatible error responses
* validation errors are handled correctly
* HTTP status codes are preserved or adapted as needed
* error payloads follow the expected frontend contract

## [](#openapi-operation-alignment)OpenAPI Operation Alignment

The generator tries to match frontend operations with backend operations based on OpenAPI metadata such as:

* HTTP method
* path
* operation ID
* request body type
* response type
* tags

## [](#action-verify-operation-matching)ACTION: Verify Operation Matching

Check generated controller methods and make sure that each frontend operation delegates to the correct backend operation.

Typical things to verify:

* `GET` endpoints call the expected backend `GET` operation
* `POST` endpoints pass request bodies correctly
* `PUT` or `PATCH` endpoints map update requests correctly
* `DELETE` endpoints handle empty responses correctly
* path parameters are forwarded in the correct order

## [](#fallback-controller-mode)Fallback Controller Mode

If the frontend OpenAPI does not contain paths, the generator may generate fallback controllers based on the backend API.

In this case, generated controllers expose backend-like endpoints and use backend model types directly.

| |  Fallback mode is useful for bootstrapping a BFF when the frontend API contract is not available yet. |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## [](#action-review-fallback-controllers)ACTION: Review Fallback Controllers

When fallback mode is used, verify:

* generated endpoints match the expected temporary API
* backend model imports are correct
* frontend-specific API contracts are added later
* fallback endpoints are replaced or adapted once the frontend OpenAPI is available

## [](#generated-tests)Generated Tests

The generator creates test scaffolding for generated controllers.

Typical generated test locations:

```text
src/test/java/<base-package>/rs/
```

Example:

```text
src/test/java/org/tkit/onecx/demo/bff/rs/ProductsRestControllerTest.java
src/test/java/org/tkit/onecx/demo/bff/rs/ProductsRestControllerIT.java
```

## [](#action-review-and-extend-tests)ACTION: Review and Extend Tests

Generated tests should be reviewed and extended.

Check whether:

* generated endpoints are tested
* authorization behavior is covered
* backend mock responses match expected contracts
* request bodies are realistic
* response assertions validate actual payloads
* error scenarios are covered

Run the tests with:

```bash
mvn test
```

## [](#build-after-customization)Build After Customization

After reviewing and customizing generated controllers, mappers and tests, build the generated project.

```bash
mvn clean package
```

If required during local development, tests can be skipped temporarily:

```bash
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

| |  Skipping tests should only be used for temporary local verification. Before committing changes, run the full test suite. |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## [](#recommended-review-checklist)Recommended Review Checklist

Use the following checklist after generation:

* Generated project builds successfully.
* Controllers call the correct backend clients.
* Request mappings are correct.
* Response mappings are correct.
* HTTP status handling is correct.
* Error handling is aligned with frontend expectations.
* Generated mapper methods are reviewed.
* OpenAPI operation matching is verified.
* Generated tests pass.
