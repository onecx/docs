[#code-of-conduct]
= OneCX Code of Conduct

== Purpose and Scope

This Code of Conduct (CoC) defines expected behavior and collaboration standards across all OneCX projects and communication spaces. It applies to maintainers, contributors, users, partners, and all participants—online and offline—during project work, reviews, meetings, events, and within supporting channels (issue trackers, pull requests, chats, forums).


== Core Principles

- Respect: Treat everyone with courtesy and consideration.
- Inclusion: Create a welcoming environment for all.
- Professionalism: Be constructive, solution‑oriented, and factual.
- Integrity: Communicate honestly, transparently, and responsibly.
- Security & Privacy: Protect data, systems, and people.


== Expected Behavior

- Helpful, respectful communication; active listening and clarifying questions.
- Constructive feedback with concrete suggestions for improvement.
- Recognition of the work and contributions of others.
- Clear, traceable rationale for technical decisions.
- Adherence to agreed processes (contribution guidelines, review rules, definition of done).
- Responsible handling of confidential information and access credentials.


== Unacceptable Behavior

The following behavior is not acceptable:

- Harassment or discrimination of any kind; derogatory or exclusionary language.
- Threats, intimidation, aggressive rhetoric, or personal attacks.
- Publishing private information without explicit consent (doxing).
- Trolling, mocking comments, off‑topic provocations, or flame wars.
- Sexually suggestive or explicit content in professional contexts.
- Disregard for privacy, security policies, or licensing requirements.


== Collaboration Spaces

This CoC applies to, among others:

- Source repositories, issues, pull requests, and code reviews
- Discussion forums, chat channels, video conferences, workshops, and meetings
- Public presentations, documentation, and release communications


== Roles and Responsibilities

- Maintainers: Lead by example, monitor adherence, resolve conflicts, and enforce appropriate actions.
- Contributors/Users: Follow the CoC, collaborate constructively, and report incidents.
- Reporters: Provide facts, examples, and context; respect confidentiality and presumption of good faith.


== Reporting Incidents

If you witness or experience a violation, report it promptly. Use the contact methods specified in the repository (e.g., a dedicated issue type, private contact to the maintainer team) or your organization’s central channels. When possible, include:

- Description of the incident and involved parties (if known)
- Location/channel, time(s), and relevant links/artifacts
- An assessment of the incident’s impact

Reports are handled sensitively and in accordance with applicable laws. Retaliation against reporters is prohibited.


== Enforcement

The maintainer team (or designated contacts) typically proceeds as follows:

1. Intake of the report and clarifying questions.
2. Preliminary review and assessment of severity.
3. Decision on actions; communication with affected parties.
4. Documentation according to internal policies and legal requirements.
5. Escalation to responsible bodies if necessary.


== Possible Actions

- Informal notice or mediated conversation
- Written warning with concrete requirements
- Temporary restriction of rights (e.g., write access)
- Removal from channels, projects, or events (temporary or permanent)
- Notification of employer, event organizers, or platform operators, where appropriate

The choice of action depends on severity, context, and repetition.


== Technical Disagreements

- Keep discussions fact‑based; reference requirements, benchmarks, standards, and security aspects.
- Use ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) or agreed decision processes where provided.
- Accept decisions once made; bring new facts for future revisions when applicable.


== Language and Communication

- Communicate clearly, professionally, and inclusively; avoid ambiguous slang.
- Use English (or the project‑specified language) consistently.
- Strive for accessible communication (e.g., descriptive links, understandable diagrams).


== Privacy and Security

- Do not share personal data without legal basis and consent.
- Follow security policies; report vulnerabilities responsibly (responsible disclosure).
- Use secret management for tokens/passwords; avoid exposing them in repositories.


== Validity and Changes

This CoC is part of the OneCX project documentation. It may be updated to reflect legal requirements, organizational processes, or industry standards. Changes are versioned and documented in the respective repository.


== Acknowledgement

This Code of Conduct is inspired by widely used industry standards and tailored for OneCX. It is intentionally concise, clear, and practical to support everyday collaboration.
