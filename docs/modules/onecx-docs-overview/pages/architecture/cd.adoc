= Continuous Delivery/Deployment - CD in OneCX

[#overview]
== Overview

OneCX supports Continuous Delivery and Deployment (CD) practices to automate the release of applications to various environments, ensuring faster and more reliable deployments.
The CD process in OneCX involves setting up automated pipelines that handle the deployment of applications from development to production environments. This includes steps such as building the application, running tests, and deploying to target environments.

OneCX encourages the use of GitOps principles for managing deployments. In a GitOps approach, the desired state of the infrastructure and applications is stored in a Git repository. Deployment tools monitor the repository for changes and automatically apply those changes to the target environments. This ensures that the deployment process is version-controlled, auditable, and reproducible.
Using GitOps in a OneCX

Project using GitOps for deployment is especially beneficial in Kubernetes environments where continuous delivery and declarative configuration are key practices. It simplifies the deployment process, improves visibility, enhances security, and helps teams maintain consistent, automated deployments across multiple clusters and environments.
