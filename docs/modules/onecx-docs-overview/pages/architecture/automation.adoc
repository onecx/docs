OneCX provides built-in support for automating the software development lifecycle through Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) practices. This ensures that code changes are automatically tested, integrated, and deployed to production environments with minimal manual intervention.


== Continuous Integration (CI)
CI in OneCX involves automatically building and testing code changes as they are committed to the version control system. This helps to identify integration issues early in the development process, ensuring that the codebase remains stable and reliable.

Key features of OneCX CI include::
* Automated builds triggered by code commits
* Execution of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
* Code quality analysis and reporting
* Notification of build and test results to developers 


== Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)
CD in OneCX focuses on automating the deployment of applications to various environments, from development to production. This allows for faster and more reliable releases, reducing the risk of human error during deployment.

Key features of OneCX CD include::
* Automated deployment pipelines for different environments
* Rollback capabilities in case of deployment failures
* Integration with infrastructure-as-code tools for environment provisioning
* Monitoring and alerting for deployed applications
