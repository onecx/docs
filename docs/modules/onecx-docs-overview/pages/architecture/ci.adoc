= Continuous Integration - CI in OneCX

[#overview]
== Overview

OneCX incorporates Continuous Integration (CI) practices to streamline the software development process by automating the building, testing, and integration of code changes. This ensures that code is consistently validated and integrated into the main codebase, reducing integration issues and enhancing overall code quality.
The CI process in OneCX involves setting up automated pipelines that trigger on code commits or pull requests. These pipelines typically include steps for compiling the code, running unit tests, performing static code analysis, and generating reports on code quality. By automating these tasks, OneCX helps development teams identify and address issues early in the development cycle.

A common CI tool used in OneCX projects is GitHub Actions.

The project employs GitHub Actions to automate various stages of their software development lifecycle, including building, testing, and deploying applications. This workflow is triggered on specific events, such as pushes to the main branch or pull requests, and is responsible for compiling the application's code, running tests, and preparing artifacts for deployment. The workflow's configuration specifies the sequence of steps to be executed, ensuring consistency and reliability in the build process. 

The use of GitHub Actions across the OneCX organization streamlines development processes, enhances collaboration among team members, and maintains high-quality standards throughout the software development lifecycle.
