= OneCX Workspace


== Overview

OneCX Workspace is the personalized working area inside the OneCX platform. It brings together pages and features from multiple OneCX applications into curated, user-centric workspaces. Users can navigate seamlessly across applications, all while respecting tenant boundaries and role-based access controls.

The Workspace focuses on productivity and coherence: it reduces context switching, exposes the most relevant tools in one place, and provides consistent navigation and theming across all integrated OneCX apps.


== Key Capabilities

- Navigation coherence: consistent routing and breadcrumbs across OneCX applications.
- Role-based visibility: menu and actions are shown based on user permissions.
- Multi-tenant awareness: all data and configuration scoped to the active tenant.
- Theming alignment: inherits styles from OneCX Theme for brand consistency.


== Architecture

The Workspace is a microfrontend UI delivered as part of the OneCX ecosystem and integrated into the OneCX Shell for composition and routing. It leverages shared UI libraries and platform services to deliver a consistent experience.

- UI app: provided by `onecx-workspace-ui` and packaged as a microfrontend.
- Shell integration: composed within `onecx-shell`, which provides top-level routing, layout, and app orchestration.
- Shared libraries: uses `onecx-portal-ui-libs` for common components, patterns, and styles.
- Platform services: interacts with OneCX APIs for authentication, permissions, tenant resolution, and workspace persistence.
- Observability: emits UI telemetry events that can be collected by platform observability tooling.

The Workspace avoids tight coupling with individual apps. Instead, it relies on app descriptors (e.g., product catalog entries) to discover capabilities and render tiles/links with the correct routes and visibility.


== Integration Points

- Authentication and authorization: integrates with OneCX IAM to enforce RBAC.
- Tenant management: respects active tenant context provided by OneCX Tenant services.
- App catalog: uses OneCX Application Store metadata to discover available apps.
- Theming: aligns with OneCX Theme for visual consistency.


== Best Practices

- Keep workspaces focused: prefer a small set of high-value tiles per view.
- Use descriptive names: make it clear what each workspace is for.
- Align with platform navigation: avoid duplicating deep links when a top-level route exists.
- Review visibility: periodically verify that tiles reflect current roles and policies.
