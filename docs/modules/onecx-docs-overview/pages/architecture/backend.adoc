= Backend Services in OneCX

[#overview]
== Overview

OneCX proposes the use of Quarkus for backend services and offers ready-to-use solutions for containerization, monitoring and deployment. 

The backend service utilizes the Quarkus framework, which is designed for building Java applications with a focus on microservices. Quarkus optimizes Java for containers and cloud-native environments, providing a lightweight and fast framework for building scalable backend services. 

Quarkus is likely being used to handle HTTP requests, manage configuration, and support integration with other services or components, while maintaining a low memory footprint and fast startup times, which are essential in modern cloud and microservice architectures. It leverages features such as dependency injection, RESTful APIs, and configuration management, making it a suitable choice for building efficient backend systems.
