= OneCX Architecture Overview

This chapter gives an overview of the fundamental architecture of OneCX. 

[#core-architecture-principles]
== Core Architecture Principles
The OneCX platform is built upon several core architectural principles that ensure scalability, flexibility, and maintainability:

* *Microservices- and microfrontend-based architecture*: The platform is composed of independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
* *Backend for frontend (BFF)*: OneCX proposes and uses the backend for frontend pattern for communication between frontend and backend.
* *API-first design*: RESTful APIs are used for communication between the frontend and backend, as well as between microservices.
* *Containerization and CI/CD*: Services are containerized using Docker, and the project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment.
* *Cloud-native architecture*: Services are designed to be deployed in cloud environments with Kubernetes for orchestration, ensuring easy scaling and high availability.


[#applications]
== Applications
To reduce testing and deployment complexity OneCX uses a concept called *application*.

* An *application* is a versioned bundle of frontends (typically: 1), BFFs (typically: 1), backend services (optional, typically one or many). +
  The frontend parts of an *application* are called *apps*.
* An *application* contains all system parts of a specific subdomain (e.g. user management).

[#workspaces]
== Workspaces
In OneCX a workspace is a set of settings for a portal for a subset of the users or for a special purpose, e.g. there could be a workspace focusing on administrating the system or one focusing on sales. The number of workspaces in the system is not limited. 

.A workspace contains the following settings:
* Basic properties like Name, Description, Logo, Base URL etc.
* Theme relationship
* Role definitions
* Menu structure for navigation including role assignments
* Application registrations as selected from the pool of available applications
* Slot configurations for Remote Components
