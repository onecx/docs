= Getting Started with OneCX

Welcome to OneCX. This guide gives you a fast path to a working local setup, points to the right deep-dive pages for building and running applications, and shares practical tips for daily development.

== Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git installed
- Modern Node.js (for frontend apps) and Java (for backend services) as required by individual apps
- A Linux shell (this guide assumes Linux; adapt paths if needed)

== Quick Start: Local Environment

The local environment is defined in the OneCX environments repository. The base services include Traefik, Postgres, Keycloak, and helper tools.

[source,bash]
----
cd environments/onecx-local-env_main

# Start Traefik (reverse proxy/dashboard)
docker compose up -d traefik

# Start the full base profile (Keycloak, Postgres, Shell UI, etc.)
docker compose up -d --profile base

# Check Traefik dashboard (inside the local network)
# http://traefik:8082/dashboard/
----

Tip: Services and UIs are labeled for Traefik. The UI routes are generally available via the `local-proxy` host with the `/mfe/<app>/` path prefix (e.g., `/mfe/workspace/`).

== Your First Application

Start with the first application guides under “First App”:

- Overview: see {page-path}/first-app/create_new_angular_app.adoc[First Angular App: Getting Started]
- Manual setup: see {page-path}/first-app/app_setup_manual.adoc[Manual App Setup]
- CLI-based setup: see {page-path}/first-app/app_setup_cli.adoc[App Setup via CLI]
- Hot reload: see {page-path}/first-app/enable_hot_reload.adoc[Enable Hot Reload]
- Running multiple apps: see {page-path}/first-app/run_multiple_apps.adoc[Run Multiple Apps]

== Build & Run

You can build container images and run them locally using Compose:

[source,bash]
----
# Example: start all core apps
cd environments/onecx-local-env_main
docker compose up -d --profile all

# Or start selective products/services using their profile labels
docker compose ps
docker compose up -d <service-name>
----

For image building, see:

- {page-path}/first-app/image_build_manual.adoc[Manual Image Build]
- {page-path}/first-app/image_build_automatic.adoc[Automatic Image Build]

== Testing & Core Apps

Learn how to run and validate existing core applications:

- {page-path}/first-app/testing_existing_core_apps.adoc[Testing Existing Core Apps]

== Local Development Tips

- Traefik routes use path prefixes like `/mfe/<app>/`. Align your local dev server’s base href with the same prefix for frictionless routing.
- Use `docker compose restart traefik` to reload file-provider changes quickly.
- Prefer `--profile` to start only the services you need.

== Troubleshooting

- Traefik route not visible: verify your file-provider config syntax and that the file lives under `environments/onecx-local-env_main/init-data/traefik/active/`.
- Health checks failing: ensure your service responds on the expected port and path (often `/`).
- Local → container fallback: use consistent path handling (shared base href) or a gateway approach if backends require different prefixes.

== Next Steps

- Explore product-specific UIs under the `apps` repositories and their corresponding services.
- Extend your local environment by enabling additional profiles and verifying integrations (permissions, tenant, theme, user-profile, etc.).

Happy building!
