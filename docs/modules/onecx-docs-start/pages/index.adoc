= Get OneCX

Welcome to OneCX. This guide gives you a clear, reliable path to set up the local development environment, run core products, and develop microfrontends roductively. It is grounded in the OneCX Local Environment.
See also: xref:onecx-local-env:index.adoc[OneCX Local Environment].


== What You’ll Set Up

- Core infrastructure: Traefik (routing), Postgres (database), Keycloak (auth)
- Core products and UIs (Shell, Workspace, Theme, etc.) via Docker Compose profiles
- A development loop for local microfrontends proxied by Traefik

== Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- Node.js (for frontends) and Java (for services), as required by specific apps
- Linux shell (adapt commands to your OS if needed)


== Initialize the Local Environment

Move into the local environment folder and start essential services.

[source,bash]
----
cd environments/onecx-local-env_main
# Start Traefik (reverse proxy + dashboard)
docker compose up -d traefik
# Start the base profile (Keycloak, Postgres, core UIs)
docker compose up -d --profile base
# Optional: start everything
docker compose up -d --profile all
# Traefik dashboard (accessible within the Docker network)
# http://traefik:8082/dashboard/
----
Compose profiles let you start focused sets of services. Common profiles include `base`, `all`, and `data-import`.

== Accessing Applications

Apps are exposed through Traefik on the `local-proxy` host using path prefixes:
- Shell UI: `/onecx-shell/`
- Product UIs: `/mfe/<product>/` (e.g., `/mfe/workspace/`, `/mfe/theme/`)
Routes become available once their containers are healthy.


== Develop a Microfrontend Locally
Run a microfrontend on your host and proxy it under the same path prefix used by the container UI. Align the base href to the product path.

[source,bash]
----
# Example: Workspace MFE on port 5025 (Angular)
ng serve --port 5025 --base-href /mfe/workspace/ --deploy-url /mfe/workspace/
----

[TIP]
- Use a shared base href (`/mfe/<app>/`) for both local and container UI to avoid path mismatches.
- After changing Traefik file-provider configs, run `docker compose restart traefik` to reload.


== Build & Run Products
Start specific services or products selectively as needed.

[source,bash]
----
# List services and health
docker compose ps
# Start a single product
docker compose up -d onecx-workspace-ui
----


== Import Seed Data (optional)
The local environment provides scripts to preload products and configuration for a realistic setup.

[source,bash]
----
# From environments/onecx-local-env_main
./import-onecx.sh
----
== Troubleshooting & Health

- Check Traefik routes and service health in the dashboard.
- Ensure services expose the expected port and respond on `/` for health checks.
- Use Compose profiles to scope startup and reduce resource usage.


== Next Steps
- Create your first Angular microfrontend: xref:./first-app/app_setup_cli.adoc[CLI Setup] or xref:./first-app/app_setup_manual.adoc[Manual Setup]
- Enable hot reload: xref:onecx-docs-start:first-app/enable_hot_reload.adoc[Hot Reload]
- Explore core applications and their services via the Applications section.


Happy building!
