= Getting Started with OneCX

The best way to get started with OneCX is to set up a local development environment and explore the provided tooling. This is the chance to get hands-on experience with OneCX and understand its architecture, core concepts, and extensibility points. +
It is grounded in the

. {onecx_local_env_docs_ref} setup process and the
. {onecx_app_generator_ref} tooling.

We assume you have basic knowledge of Web technologies and tools like Node.js, npm, and Angular.

== Let's get started!

*First*, follow the instructions in the {onecx_local_env_setup_ref} to set up your local development environment. After starting the local environment, you will have access to a running instance of OneCX with core services and applications. So you get to see OneCX in action right away. Make you familiar with the provided applications and services and how to configure them.

*Next*, you can

* Integrate existing microfrontends and microservices into OneCX => see {onecx_local_env_extend_ref} and/or
* Building new microfrontends and microservices to be integrated into OneCX => see {onecx_docs_dev_ref}.

See this guide to create your first OneCX Application: {onecx_docs_apps_create}.


== Beyond Starting

For more advanced topics, refer to the {onecx_docs_dev_ref}, which covers various aspects of developing applications and services for OneCX, including state management, API integration, theming, and deployment strategies.

We recommend exploring the following resources to deepen your understanding of OneCX:

* The {onecx_docs_overview_ref} provides a high-level introduction to the OneCX platform, its architecture, and key concepts.
* The {onecx_docs_apps_ref} offers insights into the various applications available within OneCX, their functionalities, and how they interact with each other.
* The {onecx_local_env_docs_ref} provides comprehensive instructions on setting up and using the local development environment, including how to run, debug, and test OneCX applications and services.
* The {onecx_app_generator_ref} is a powerful tool to scaffold new OneCX applications and services quickly. It helps you to create the necessary project structure, configuration files, and boilerplate code for your microfrontends and microservices, following OneCX best practices.
