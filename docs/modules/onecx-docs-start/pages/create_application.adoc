= Creating a OneCX Application

This guide walks you through the process of creating a simple OneCX Application using the OneCX App Generator and integrating it into your local OneCX environment.

What is a OneCX Application?::
A OneCX Application is a set of microfrontends and services that together provide specific functionality within the OneCX platform. It typically consists of a user interface (a microfrontend) and backend services that support its operations. A OneCX Application is designed to be modular, scalable, and easily integrable with other applications within the OneCX ecosystem.
