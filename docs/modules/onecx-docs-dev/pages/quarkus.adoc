= Quarkus in OneCX
== Overview
Quarkus is the chosen Java framework for building microservices within the OneCX platform. It offers a cloud-native, container-first approach that aligns with OneCX's goals for scalability, performance, and developer productivity.
This documentation module covers how Quarkus is utilized in OneCX, including core concepts, extensions, best practices, and integration points.


== Key Concepts
* **Supersonic Subatomic Java**: Quarkus is designed to be lightweight and fast, making it ideal for containerized environments.
* **Developer Experience**: Features like live reload and streamlined configuration enhance developer productivity.
* **Native Compilation**: Quarkus supports compiling Java applications to native binaries using GraalVM, reducing startup time and memory footprint.
* **Extensions**: Quarkus has a rich ecosystem of extensions that provide integrations with databases, messaging systems, and cloud services.


== OneCX Quarkus Extensions
OneCX provides a set of custom xref:documentation:onecx-quarkus-extensions:index.adoc[Quarkus extensions] that encapsulate common functionality needed across microservices:

* **onecx-core**: Base extension with shared utilities and configurations.
* **onecx-permissions**: Manages role-based access control and permission checks.
* **onecx-tenant**: Handles multi-tenancy concerns, including tenant resolution and context propagation.
* **onecx-parameters**: Facilitates configuration management and parameter injection.
* **onecx-openapi-generator**: Automates OpenAPI specification generation for RESTful services
* **onecx-validator**: Provides validation utilities for request and response payloads.
* **onecx-operator**: Supports Kubernetes operator patterns for managing application lifecycle.
