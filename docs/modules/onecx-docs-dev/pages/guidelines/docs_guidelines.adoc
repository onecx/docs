= OneCX Documentation Guidelines
== Purpose

These guidelines define how to write documentation for OneCX projects using {antora_doc_link} and {asciidoc_doc_link}.


== Core Guidelines
[horizontal]
Simplicity::  Keep content straightforward and focused on user needs. +
              = No prosaic explanations. +
              = Follow the {kiss_principle_link} principle.
Clarity::     Write clear, concise instructions with examples, code snippets, and visuals.
Consistency:: Use a uniform structure, style, and terminology to make docs easy to navigate. +
              = Check linked resources before publish your docs.
Modularity::  Organize content into reusable modules and partials for maintainability. +
              = Leverage includes and partials to avoid duplication
Navigation::  Provide intuitive navigation with a well-structured sidebar and cross-references. +
              = Use meaningful link text instead of raw URLs. +
              = Use xref: for internal links. +
              = Ensure all links are valid and up-to-date. +
              = Do not use excessively deep nesting levels – a maximum of 3-4 levels – and split a page if necessary.
Readability:: Use formatting, headings, lists, and visuals as used within the reference implementation to enhance comprehension. +
              = Avoid using your own formatting styles that differ from the reference implementation.
Error-free::  Proofread content to eliminate typos, grammatical errors, and technical inaccuracies. +
              = Check console output after building the website.


[NOTE]
The *reference implementation* is the documentation of {onecx_local_env_docs_url}[onecx-local-env]. +
Follow the idea of structure, used {asciidoc_doc_link} features, navigation and conventions.


== Main Structure of Documentation
The OneCX documentation is organized by a *parent site* (see {onecx_docs_repo_link}) that *aggregates* multiple *modules* (e.g. onecx-local-env, onecx-docs-apps).

* The parent site defines all basics for the Antora project. Do not add concurrent settings in the local `antora.yml` of modules. The name of the component in the parent site and ALL modules is *documentation*.
* Each OneCX project (application, UI libraries etc.) must have its own corresponding module. The module name must follow the project name and be unique.

When creating documentation for a new OneCX project, follow this guideline for structuring your module:


[horizontal]
Component name::  = Use the shared component *documentation* (in `antora.yml`). +
                  = This integrates your docs into the parent OneCX docs site.
Version::         Use *latest* (in `antora.yml`) to always point to the most recent docs. +
                  = Versioning is handled at the parent site level.
Module::          Create a dedicated module per project, e.g. `modules/<your-project>/` with subfolders: +
	pages:::     Contains pages (`*.adoc`)
	images:::    Project-specific images referenced from pages.
	partials:::  Reusable fragments like `attributes.adoc` and `nav.adoc`.
