== Purpose & Value

- Orientation: quick overview of areas, concepts, and timelines.
- Context: positioning of products, UIs, services, and architectures.
- Paths: targeted entry points for different roles (engineering, operations, product).

== Topic Map

- Platform Overview: vision, product landscape, core components.
- Architecture & Components: Shell, BFFs, services, data, Traefik.
- Domain Concepts: tenancy, permissions, profile, theme, workspace.
- Development Workflows: local setup, generator, CI/CD fundamentals.
- UI Libraries & Patterns: design system, reuse, best practices.
- Security & Tenancy: OIDC, Keycloak, tenant context, permissions.
- Data & Integrations: Postgres, REST APIs, configurations.
- Operations & Tooling: logs, health checks, Traefik dashboard, profiles.

== Entry Paths

- Beginner: foundational concepts and first working setup.
- Builder: app creation (manual/CLI), hot reload, multiple apps.
- Integrator: interplay of UIs and services, routing, profiles.

== Practical Tips

- Traefik uses path prefixes like `/mfe/<app>/`; align your dev server base href accordingly.
- Use Docker Compose profiles to start only the services you need.
- The Traefik dashboard helps analyze routing and health checks.

== Conventions

- Consistent paths, naming conventions, and shared UI patterns ease integration.
- Prefer reusable libraries from `onecx-portal-ui-libs`.

== Contribute

- Contributions welcome: add content, report gaps, improve examples.
- Follow the existing structure and link appropriately.
