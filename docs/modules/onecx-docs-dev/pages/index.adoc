== Practical Tips

- Traefik uses path prefixes like `/mfe/<app>/`; align your dev server base href accordingly.
- Use Docker Compose profiles to start only the services you need.
- The Traefik dashboard helps analyze routing and health checks.

== Conventions

- Consistent paths, naming conventions, and shared UI patterns ease integration.
- Prefer reusable libraries from `onecx-portal-ui-libs`.

== Contribute

- Contributions welcome: add content, report gaps, improve examples.
- Follow the existing structure and link appropriately.
