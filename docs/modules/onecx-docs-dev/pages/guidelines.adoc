= OneCX Development Guidelines

== Purpose
This document outlines the development guidelines for contributing to the OneCX platform.

== Scope
These guidelines apply to all developers contributing to OneCX projects.

== Coding Standards
- Follow established coding conventions for the programming languages used (e.g., TypeScript, Java, JavaScript).
- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code.
- Use meaningful variable and function names that convey intent.
- Adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to minimize code duplication.

== Version Control
- Use Git for version control and follow a branching strategy (e.g., Git Flow, feature branches).
- Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes made.
- Regularly pull changes from the main branch to keep your feature branch up to date.

== Code Reviews
- Submit pull requests for all changes and request reviews from team members.
- Provide constructive feedback during code reviews and be open to receiving feedback.
- Ensure that code reviews focus on functionality, readability, and adherence to guidelines.

== Testing
- Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- Aim for high test coverage and ensure tests are reliable and maintainable.
- Use automated testing tools and frameworks as appropriate for the project.

== Documentation
- Document code with comments and maintain up-to-date README files.
- Create and update architectural decision records (ADRs) for significant design choices.
- Ensure that user-facing documentation is clear and comprehensive.

== Continuous Integration and Deployment
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment processes.
- Ensure that all tests pass before merging code into the main branch.
- Follow deployment guidelines to minimize downtime and ensure smooth releases.

== Collaboration and Communication
- Participate in team meetings, stand-ups, and retrospectives.
- Use collaboration tools (e.g., Slack, Jira) effectively to communicate progress and blockers.
- Foster a positive and inclusive team environment.
