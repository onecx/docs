= OneCX Docs: Writing Style

This document outlines the preferred writing style for OneCX documentation to ensure clarity, consistency, and professionalism across all content.

== General Principles
* Write for the target audience, considering their technical background and needs.
* Be direct and actionable; prefer imperative voice.
* Structure content logically with clear headings.
* Keep headings consistent (`==`, `===`) and limit nesting to 3–4 levels.
* Use bullets and description lists for procedures and options.
* Add screenshots for critical steps and outcomes.
* Avoid duplication by using partials and includes.
* Keep labels short, be focsused and avoid unnecessary words.
* Each line in lists should start with a capital letter and end without a period, unless it is a complete sentence.
* Language
** Do not use colloquial language or slang. +
   e.g. do not use cookbook terms like "whip up" or "cook". +
   We do not write cookbooks and recipes but technical documentation.
** Use active voice and present tense.
** Prefer simple words over complex ones. +
   e.g. use "use" instead of "utilize".
** Write in a clear and concise manner; avoid unnecessary words.
** Avoid jargon unless necessary; explain technical terms when first introduced.
** Use technical terms consistently as per the reference implementation.
* Text Emphasis
** Use emphasis sparingly to highlight *important* terms.
** Do not use more than one text emphasis per word (e.g. _italic_ or **bold**).

== Terminology
* Use official product names consistently (e.g. OneCX, OneCX Local Environment).
* Define acronyms on first use (e.g. BPMN - Business Process Model and Notation).
* Use consistent terminology for features and components across all documentation.
* Avoid internal jargon; prefer terms that are widely understood by the target audience.

== Tone and Voice
* Maintain a professional and approachable tone.
* Be encouraging and supportive, especially in troubleshooting sections.
* Avoid humor or sarcasm, as it may not translate well across cultures.
* Focus on user tasks and outcomes rather than internal processes.

== Examples
* Provide realistic and runnable examples where possible.
* Ensure examples are up-to-date with the latest software versions.
* Avoid including sensitive information (e.g. passwords, API keys) in examples.
* Use consistent formatting for code snippets and commands.
** Use fenced code blocks with language hints (e.g. `source,js`).
** Minimize boilerplate code; focus on relevant parts.

== Review and Feedback
* Encourage peer reviews to ensure clarity and accuracy.
* Incorporate user feedback to improve documentation quality over time.
