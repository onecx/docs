= OneCX Docs: Writing Style

This document outlines the preferred writing style for OneCX documentation to ensure clarity, consistency, and professionalism across all content.

== General Principles

* Write for the target audience, considering their technical background and needs.
* Be direct and actionable; prefer imperative voice.
* Structure content logically with clear headings.
* Keep headings consistent (`==`, `===`) and limit nesting to 3–4 levels.
* Use bullets and description lists for procedures and options.
* Add screenshots for critical steps and outcomes.
* Avoid duplication by using partials and includes.
* Keep labels short.
* Language
** Do not use colloquial language or slang. +
   e.g. do not use cookbook terms like "whip up" or "cook". +
   We do not write cookbooks and recipes but technical documentation.
** Use active voice and present tense.
** Prefer simple words over complex ones. +
   e.g. use "use" instead of "utilize".
** Write in a clear and concise manner; avoid unnecessary words.
** Avoid jargon unless necessary; explain technical terms when first introduced.
** Use technical terms consistently as per the reference implementation.
* Text Emphasis
** Use emphasis sparingly to highlight *important* terms.
** Do not use more than one text emphasis per word (e.g. _italic_ or **bold**).
