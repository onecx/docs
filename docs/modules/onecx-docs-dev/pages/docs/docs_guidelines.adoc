= OneCX Docs: Guidelines

These guidelines provide a framework for creating clear, consistent and user-friendly documentation for OneCX projects using {antora_doc_link} and {asciidoc_doc_link}. +
They are designed to help authors produce high-quality content that meets the needs of our users and contributors.


== Core Guidelines

Simplicity::  Keep content straightforward and focused on user needs. +
              = No prosaic explanations. +
              = Follow the {kiss_principle_link} principle.
Clarity::     Write clear, concise instructions with examples, code snippets, and visuals.
Consistency:: Use a uniform structure, style, and terminology to make docs easy to navigate. +
              = Check linked resources before publish your docs.
Modularity::  Organize content into reusable modules and partials for maintainability. +
              = Leverage includes and partials to avoid duplication
Navigation::  Provide intuitive navigation with a well-structured sidebar and cross-references. +
              = Use meaningful link text instead of raw URLs. +
              = Use xref: for internal links. +
              = Ensure all links are valid and up-to-date. +
              = Do not use excessively deep nesting levels – a maximum of 3-4 levels.
Readability:: Use formatting, headings, lists, and visuals as used within 
              the reference implementation to enhance comprehension. +
              = Avoid using your own formatting styles that differ from the reference implementation.
Error-free::  Proofread content to eliminate typos, grammatical errors, and technical inaccuracies. +
              = Check console output after building the website.


== Contribution Workflow
- Start with small, focused PRs; write clear descriptions.
- Reference issues when applicable; include screenshots for UI docs.
- Follow existing repository lint/format rules; keep diffs minimal.
- Review feedback constructively; iterate promptly.
- Prefer evergreen docs that age slowly; call out version specifics.


== Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Overly complex explanations that confuse users.
- Inconsistent terminology or formatting that hinders navigation.
- Redundant content that could be modularized.
- Broken links or outdated references.
- Own formatting styles that differ from the reference implementation.
- Nested headings beyond 3-4 levels.


== Writing Style
For detailed writing style guidelines, see the {onecx_docs_writing_style_ref} document.


== Reference
The *reference implementation* is the documentation of {onecx_local_env_docs_ref}. +
Follow the idea of structure, used {asciidoc_doc_link} features, navigation and conventions.
