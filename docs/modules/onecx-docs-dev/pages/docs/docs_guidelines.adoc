= OneCX Docs: Guidelines

These guidelines provide a framework for creating clear, consistent and user-friendly documentation for OneCX projects using {antora_doc_link} and {asciidoc_doc_link}. +
Detailed instructions on how to write OneCX documentation can be found at {onecx_docs_guide_ref}.

== Core Guidelines
[horizontal,labelwidth=15]
Simplicity::  Keep content straightforward and focused on user needs. +
              = No prosaic explanations. +
              = Follow the {kiss_principle_link} principle.
Clarity::     Write clear, concise instructions with examples, code snippets, and visuals.
Consistency:: Use a uniform structure, style, and terminology to make docs easy to navigate. +
              = Check linked resources before publish your docs.
Modularity::  Organize content into reusable modules and partials for maintainability. +
              = Leverage includes and partials to avoid duplication
Navigation::  Provide intuitive navigation with a well-structured sidebar and cross-references. +
              = Use meaningful link text instead of raw URLs. +
              = Use xref: for internal links. +
              = Ensure all links are valid and up-to-date. +
              = Do not use excessively deep nesting levels – a maximum of 3-4 levels – and split a page if necessary.
Readability:: Use formatting, headings, lists, and visuals as used within 
              the reference implementation to enhance comprehension. +
              = Avoid using your own formatting styles that differ from the reference implementation.
Error-free::  Proofread content to eliminate typos, grammatical errors, and technical inaccuracies. +
              = Check console output after building the website.


== Writing Style

For detailed writing style guidelines, see the {onecx_docs_writing_style_ref} document.


== Reference Implementation
The *reference implementation* is the documentation of {onecx_local_env_docs_ref}[onecx-local-env]. +
Follow the idea of structure, used {asciidoc_doc_link} features, navigation and conventions.
