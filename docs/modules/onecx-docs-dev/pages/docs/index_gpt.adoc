= OneCX Documentation

Welcome to the OneCX documentation hub for contributors and users.
This page is your entry point to the guides, conventions, and tooling
used to write and publish OneCX documentation.

== Purpose
The goal of this guide is to keep documentation simple, consistent,
and easy to maintain across the OneCX ecosystem, following {kiss_principle_link}.
We author content in {asciidoc_doc_link} and publish sites using {antora_doc_link}.

== Audience
- Developers and technical writers authoring or reviewing docs
- Product owners wanting an overview of available guides
- Contributors integrating new modules or updating existing content

== Structure and Key Guides
Documentation is organized into topic-focused guides and modules:
- UI guide: patterns for frontend docs and examples (Angular/SPA)
- BPMN guide: process modeling and workflow documentation
- Quarkus guide: backend services, extensions, and testing practices
- Local environment docs: running and previewing docs in a local setup ({onecx_local_env_docs_ref})
See {onecx_docs_repo_link} for repository layout and contributing entry points.

== Quick Start for Authors
1. Install prerequisites: Node.js (LTS) and Antora CLI.
2. Open the OneCX workspace in VS Code.
3. Create pages under the appropriate module folder (e.g., `modules/<module>/pages/`).
4. Use kebab-case filenames (e.g., `getting-started.adoc`).
5. Keep content focused; split long pages into smaller topics.

=== Build Locally
Run a local site build to preview changes.

```bash
cd /home/henry/onecx
npx antora docs/antora-playbook-local-env.yml
```

If the Antora CLI isn't installed, install with:

```bash
npm install --global @antora/cli @antora/site-generator-default
```

== Authoring Guidelines
For complete conventions, see {onecx_docs_guideline_ref}. Highlights:
- Headings: title with `=` once, then `==`/`===` for subsections; sentence case.
- File naming: lowercase, hyphenated, descriptive.
- Metadata: use page attributes for `:description:` and `:keywords:` when helpful.
- Admonitions: NOTE/TIP/IMPORTANT/WARNING for emphasis and safety.
- Code: fenced or source blocks with language hints (e.g., `source,js`), minimal boilerplate.
- Links: use `xref:` for internal references; prefer stable anchors over brittle relative paths.
- Images: store under the module `images` directory, add alt text and optional width.
- Diagrams: keep PlantUML sources in the shared `_plantuml` folder; export SVG for web.

== Style Guide (Short)
- Voice: concise, active, task-oriented.
- Terminology: consistent product names; avoid internal jargon.
- Formatting: wrap at ~120 chars, no trailing spaces.
- Examples: realistic and runnable where possible; remove secrets.

== Navigation and Module Layout
- Modules group related topics; keep pages small and well-titled.
- If a `nav.adoc` exists, add new pages there to surface them in the sidebar.
- Prefer cross-links between guides rather than duplicating content.

== Contribution Workflow
- Start with small, focused PRs; write clear descriptions.
- Reference issues when applicable; include screenshots for UI docs.
- Follow existing repository lint/format rules; keep diffs minimal.

== Versioning and Stability
- Prefer evergreen docs that age slowly; call out version specifics.
- Mark experimental features clearly; avoid promising timelines in docs.

== Diagrams and Assets
- Store sources alongside docs or in `_plantuml` for shared diagrams.
- Optimize images; prefer SVG for vector assets.

== Troubleshooting
- Antora build failures: check `antora.yml` and module paths.
- Broken links: verify `xref:` targets and page IDs.
- Styling issues: ensure docs-antora-ui is up to date.

== FAQ
- Where do I start? Use this page, then open the relevant guide.
- How do I preview? Run the local build commands and open the output site.
- Who maintains docs? Each module is owned by its product team; cross-cutting guidelines are collaborative.

== Next Steps
- Read {onecx_docs_guideline_ref} for detailed rules.
- Explore UI, BPMN, and Quarkus guides for patterns and examples.
- Build locally and iterate with small PRs.
