= OneCX Documentation

Welcome to the OneCX documentation hub for contributors and users.
This page is your entry point to the guides, conventions, and tooling
used to write and publish OneCX documentation.

== Purpose
The goal of this guide is to keep documentation simple, consistent
and easy to maintain across the OneCX ecosystem.
We author content in {asciidoc_doc_link} and publish sites using {antora_doc_link}.

== Audience
- Developers and technical writers authoring or reviewing docs
- Product owners wanting an overview of available guides
- Contributors integrating new modules or updating existing content

== Authoring Guidelines
* Follow the general guidelines in {onecx_docs_guideline_ref}.
* For writing style guidelines, see {onecx_docs_writing_style_ref}.
* For writing locally testable docs, see {onecx_docs_setup_ref}.
* For formatting and conventions, see {onecx_docs_formatting_ref}.

== Getting Started
To set up your local environment for writing and previewing OneCX documentation, follow the instructions in {onecx_docs_setup_ref}.

== Reference
See the {onecx_local_env_docs_ref} - it is our reference implementation for structure, style and conventions.
