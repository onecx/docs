It ensures consistency, maintainability, and clarity across all OneCX applications. However, they may not cover every possible use case or technical scenario. Follow an API-first approach: design OpenAPI spec before implementation. Use consistent naming and DTO patterns. Prefer plural nouns for resource names. Use standard HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE. Define your objects in the schemas tab and use references to them in your endpoint definitions. Avoid code duplication, if possible reuse your objects. Avoid the use of quotation marks for tags, descriptions etc. if not really needed. Use versioning in the URL path: /v1, /v2, etc. For internal APIs use /internal/. Make sure to include the version into the name of your OpenAPI file e.g. hello-world-v1.yaml. Use the version tag at the top of your OpenAPI file to set the version. Use plural form of entity names: /themes, /users. Use up to 2 path parameters.

When you encounter an issue like an injection error, application is not loading, blank page, etc., please do the following steps first which should resolve most of the common issues: Make sure that the App is OneCX compatible and you followed the guidelines. To better debug your App, you need to disable the minified build. In your project.json or angular.json file, set \"optimization\" to false in the build options which will disable minification of the build files for all configurations (production, development).: Example for all builds { ... \"targets\": { ... \"build\": { ... \"options\": { \"optimization\": false, ... } ... } ... } } ... If you want to disable minification only for a specific build, set \"optimization\" to false in the respective configuration: Example for production build { ... \"targets\": { ... \"build\": { ... \"configurations\": { \"production\": { \"optimization\": false, ... } ... } ... } ... } } ... If you get an error like this: Error: bundle initial exceeded maximum budget. Budget 1.05 MB was not met by 267.90 kB with a total of 1.32 MB. Increase the budget in the budgets section of your project.json or angular.json file. Example budgets section { ... \"targets\": { ... \"build\": { ... \"configurations\": { \"production\": { \"optimization\": false, \"budgets\": [ { ... \"maximumError\": \"1.5mb\" }, ... ] ... } ... } ... } ... } } ... In this example you can see the difference between a minified and a non-minified code snippet in the DevTool’s Sources tab. Table 1. Example code snippet in DevTool’s Sources tab minified non-minified ... ), (0, x.on)(k.searchButtonClicked, (t, {searchCriteria: s}) => ({ ...t, criteria: s })), (0, x.on)(k.resetButtonClicked, t => ({ ...t, criteria: {} })), (0, x.on)(k.tenantSearchResultsReceived, (t, {results: s}) => ({ ...t, results: s })), (0, ... ... search(formValue) { const searchCriteria = Object.entries(formValue.getRawValue()) .reduce((acc, [key, value]) => ({ ...acc, [key]: this.isVisible(key) ? (0,_shared_utils_isValidDate_utils__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_5__ .isValidDate)(value) ? new Date(Date.UTC(value.getFullYear(), value.getMonth(), value.getDate(), value.getHours(), value.getMinutes(), value.getSeconds())) : value {vbar}{vbar} null : null }), {}); this.store.dispatch(_tenant_search_actions__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_6__ .TenantSearchActions.searchButtonClicked({ searchCriteria })); } resetSearch() { this.store.dispatch(_tenant_search_actions__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_6__ .TenantSearchActions.resetButtonClicked()); } ... In this example you can see the difference between a minified and a non-minified NullInjectorError message in the console. Table 2. Example NullInjectorError non-minified in App minified non-minified ERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError[PortalDialogService -> i -> i -> i]: NullInjectorError: No provider for i! ERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError[i -> i -> i -> i]: NullInjectorError: No provider for i! In cases like above you are still seeing names like \"i\" in the non-minified error message, then you should additionally disable the minified build for the Shell locally, too. Clone the Shell repository https://github.com/onecx/onecx-shell-ui Run npm install Set \"optimization\" to false in the project.json file of the Shell. Depending on your App’s Angular version, set the \"optimization\" option in the corresponding pre_loaders/angular-<version>/project.json file. E.g.: for Angular 18 in the pre_loaders/angular-18/project.json Then to start Shell locally, refer to Automatic Image Build which builds from your local source code each time you run docker compose or Manual Image Build for manual image building. Table 3. Example NullInjectorError non-minified in App + Shell App non-minified App + Shell non-minified ERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError[PortalDialogService -> i -> i -> i]: NullInjectorError: No provider for i! ERROR NullInjectorError: R3InjectorError[PortalDialogService -> DialogService -> DialogService -> DialogService]: NullInjectorError: No provider for DialogService! Verify if all necessary packages are shared in your webpack.config.js: angular packages onecx packages rxjs primeng ngx-translate ngrx packages Check in your package.json which of the mentioned packages are installed: Example package.json ... \"dependencies\": { ... \"@angular/core\": \"^18.2.12\", \"@angular/forms\": \"^18.2.12\", \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^18.2.12\", \"@angular/router\": \"^18.2.12\", \"@ngx-translate/core\": \"^15.0.0\", \"@onecx/accelerator\": \"^5.48.3\", \"@onecx/integration-interface\": \"^5.48.3\", \"primeng\": \"^17.18.11\", \"rxjs\": \"~7.8.1\", ... }, ... Check your webpack.config.json if those packages are shared and add them if they are missing: Table 4. Example webpack.config.js Correct (✓) Incorrect (✗) webpack.config.js ... shared: share({ '@angular/common': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: { skip: ['@angular/common/http/testing'] }, }, '@angular/common/http': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true, }, '@angular/core': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@angular/forms': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@angular/platform-browser': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true, }, '@angular/router': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@ngx-translate/core': { requiredVersion: 'auto' }, primeng: { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, rxjs: { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@onecx/accelerator': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@onecx/integration-interface': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true, }, ... }), ... webpack.config.js ... shared: share({ '@angular/common': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: { skip: ['@angular/common/http/testing'] }, }, '@angular/common/http': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true, }, '@angular/forms': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@angular/platform-browser': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true, }, '@angular/router': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@ngx-translate/core': { requiredVersion: 'auto' }, primeng: { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@onecx/accelerator': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, // MISSING: '@angular/core' // MISSING: 'rxjs' // MISSING: '@onecx/integration-interface' ... }), ... Verify if all shared packages have the caret '^' sign in your package.json (except for rxjs it is a tilde '~'). For that, first check your webpack.config.js which packages are being shared: Example webpack.config.js ... shared: share({ '@angular/common': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: { skip: ['@angular/common/http/testing'] }, }, '@angular/common/http': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true, }, '@angular/core': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@angular/forms': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@angular/platform-browser': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true, }, '@angular/router': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@ngx-translate/core': { requiredVersion: 'auto' }, primeng: { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@onecx/accelerator': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, ... }), ... Then check if the correct range (caret '^' or tilde '~' for rxjs) is present for the shared packages in your package.json: Table 5. Example package.json Correct (✓) Incorrect (✗) package.json ... \"dependencies\": { ... \"@angular/common\": \"^18.2.12\", \"@angular/core\": \"^18.2.12\", \"@angular/forms\": \"^18.2.12\", \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"^18.2.12\", \"@angular/router\": \"^18.2.12\", \"@ngx-translate/core\": \"^15.0.0\", \"@onecx/accelerator\": \"^5.48.3\", \"@onecx/integration-interface\": \"^5.48.3\", \"primeng\": \"^17.18.11\", \"rxjs\": \"~7.8.1\", ... }, ... package.json ... \"dependencies\": { ... \"@angular/common\": \"18.2.12\", \"@angular/core\": \"18.2.12\", \"@angular/forms\": \"18.2.12\", \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"18.2.12\", \"@angular/router\": \"18.2.12\", \"@ngx-translate/core\": \"15.0.0\", \"@onecx/accelerator\": \"5.48.3\", \"@onecx/integration-interface\": \"5.48.3\", \"primeng\": \"17.18.11\", \"rxjs\": \"7.8.1\", ... }, ... Do a clean install and build of the App: Remove .angular and .nx folder Remove node_modules and package-lock.json Run following command to clear the npm cache: npm cache clean --force Install all packages: npm install Build the App Verify if the Remote Module name in the webpack.config.js is the same as the Remote Module setting in the Application Store. Navigate to the Application Store → open the App → click on the 'Components' tab → open the 'Module' UI Component → check App ID: Table 6. Example webpack.config.js and Application Store setting (remote module name) webpack.config.js Application Store ... const config = withModuleFederationPlugin({ name: 'onecx-workspace-ui', filename: 'remoteEntry.js', exposes: { './OneCXWorkspaceModule': 'src/main.ts', ... } }), ... Verify if the tag name for the component is the same as the tag name set in the Application Store: Table 7. Example values.yaml and Application Store setting (tag name) values.yaml Application Store values.yaml ... microfrontend: enabled: true specs: main: exposedModule: \"./OneCXWorkspaceModule\" description: \"OneCX Workspace UI\" note: \"OneCX Workspace UI auto import via MF operator\" type: MODULE technology: WEBCOMPONENTMODULE remoteName: onecx-workspace tagName: ocx-workspace-component endpoints: - name: workspace-detail path: /{workspace-name} ... Make sure you are using the latest version of the Shell. Verify if the Angular version of the App is lower than the Shell’s. Go to the browser’s DevTools and run in the console following command: DevTools Console window['onecxWebpackContainer'] You will get a list of all the shared packages. Check e.g. the @angular/core entry to see the versions: The error typically occurs when there’s more than 1 version of webpack used by the packages. It is a common issue if the @angular-devkit/build-angular library is used. To resolve the issue check the webpack versions requested by the packages and adjust so only one version remains. In order to check webpack versions execute npm ls webpack command. This command is going to show the exact package version used per dependency. Errors indicating issues with webpack compilation are related to multiple versions used in the project. In order to fix the issue: run npm ls webpack identify packages with different webpack version ensure only 1 version of webpack is present To use only 1 version of webpack, you should adjust the versions of the packages that depend on webpack to use the same version. You can do this by updating the package.json file to specify compatible versions or by using npm overrides feature. If the application is not showing up and errors like t is not a function are in the console, then most likely the builder and the Angular packages used in the project are not compatible. To resolve the issue: make sure that the builder used in the project is compatible with the Angular version used e.g., for Angular 18 and ngx-build-plus package use version ^18.0.0","title":"Troubleshooting","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"troubleshooting","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-docs-guides/troubleshooting.html","titles":[{"text":"General Troubleshooting Steps","hash":"general-troubleshooting-steps","id":1},{"text":"OneCX Compatibility","hash":"onecx-compatibility","id":2},{"text":"Disable minified build","hash":"disable-minified-build","id":3},{"text":"Webpack Configuration","hash":"webpack-configuration","id":4},{"text":"Installed Packages","hash":"installed-packages","id":5},{"text":"Clean Install and Build","hash":"clean-install-build","id":6},{"text":"Application Setup/Settings","hash":"application-setup-settings","id":7},{"text":"Shell related","hash":"shell-related","id":8},{"text":"TypeError: The 'compilation' argument must be an instance of Compilation","hash":"compilation-must-be-instance-of-compilation","id":9},{"text":"Specific issues","hash":"specific-issues","id":10},{"text":"The 'compilation' argument must be an instance of Compilation","hash":"webpack-compilation","id":11},{"text":"Application is not showing up and \"t is not a function\" error is in console","hash":"angular-compilation","id":12}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"OneCX is a platform that allows projects to easily build systems with microservice and microfrontend architecture and utilize the advantage of those architectures in regards of scales agile development.

This method requires a correct Helm setup for your application as it is generated with the OneCX generator. If Helm values are missing or incorrect, the CLI may not work as expected. To sync the app with your local environment, navigate to your hello-world UI folder and run: npx @onecx/local-env-cli sync ui hello-world /hello-world ./helm/values.yaml -e /path/to/onecx-local-env -n hello-world-ui In this command: hello-world refers to the product name. /hello-world specifies the product’s base path. ./helm/values.yaml is the path to the application’s values.yaml file. -e /path/to/onecx-local-env should be adjusted to the path of your local onecx-local-env repository. -n hello-world-ui specifies the name of the microfrontend service. This command will update your onecx-local-env with the necessary information about your new application’s UI. To add the UI as an image to the docker-compose.yaml of your onecx-local-env, run (adjust the path as needed): npx @onecx/local-env-cli docker hello-world create hello-world helloWorld -e /path/to/onecx-local-env -s ui In this command: - hello-world after docker refers to the name of the custom docker compose that will be created. - hello-world after create references the product name. - helloWorld is the name of the UI path as defined in the values.yaml of the application UI.

A hello-world.docker-compose.yaml should now be created in the onecx-local-env, containing an image for hello-world-ui. In the same way as for the UI we can also handle the BFF and SVC of our application by using the commands in the General Getting Started guide. For more details regarding the usage of the CLI, see the onecx-local-env-cli README.

First, we need to add the permission assignments for our application by adding the following code under assignments in imports > assignments > onecx.json. onecx.json \"hello-world\": { \"hello-world-ui\": { \"onecx-admin\": { \"HELLO\": [ \"CREATE\", \"EDIT\", \"DELETE\", \"SAVE\", \"IMPORT\", \"EXPORT\", \"VIEW\", \"SEARCH\", \"BACK\" ] } }, \"onecx-hello-world-bff\": { \"onecx-admin\": { \"hello\": [ \"read\", \"write\", \"delete\" ] } } } Then we need to define our application by creating the following file in imports > product-store > microfrontends. The file name must match the shown pattern consisting of product name (here: hello-world), microservice(hello-world-ui) and UI component(main). hello-world_hello-world-ui_main.microfrontend.json { \"appVersion\": \"xxx\", \"appName\": \"hello-world\", \"description\": \"OneCX HelloWorld Module\", \"remoteBaseUrl\": \"/mfe/helloWorld/\", \"remoteEntry\": \"/mfe/helloWorld/remoteEntry.js\", \"note\": \"OneCX HelloWorld UI module auto import via MF operator\", \"exposedModule\": \"./HelloWorldModule\", \"technology\": \"WEBCOMPONENTMODULE\", \"remoteName\": \"hello-world\", \"tagName\": \"hello-world-webcomponent\", \"type\": \"MODULE\", \"deprecated\": false, \"undeployed\": false } The appName matches the product name. The remoteBaseUrl should match the routing path in your app’s helm values.yaml. The exposedModule should match the module name, that is exposed in your app’s webpack config. The tagName can be found in the remoteModule ts file in the ngDoBootstrap() function. We also need to add the permissions for our application by creating the following file in imports > product-store > permissions. The file name must match the shown pattern consisting of product name (here: hello-world) and microservice(hello-world-ui). hello-world_hello-world-ui.json { \"name\": \"hello-world-ui\", \"permissions\": [ { \"resource\": \"HELLO\", \"action\": \"CREATE\" }, { \"resource\": \"HELLO\", \"action\": \"EDIT\" }, { \"resource\": \"HELLO\", \"action\": \"DELETE\" }, { \"resource\": \"HELLO\", \"action\": \"SAVE\" }, { \"resource\": \"HELLO\", \"action\": \"IMPORT\" }, { \"resource\": \"HELLO\", \"action\": \"EXPORT\" }, { \"resource\": \"HELLO\", \"action\": \"VIEW\" }, { \"resource\": \"HELLO\", \"action\": \"SEARCH\" } ] } The permissions need to match the permissions defined in your applications values.yaml. Then the UI microservice needs to be defined by creating the following file in imports > product-store > microservices. The file name must match the shown pattern consisting of product name (here: hello-world) and microservice(hello-world-ui). hello-world_hello-world-ui.json { \"version\": \"xxx\", \"description\": \"hello-world-ui\", \"name\": \"hello-world-ui\", \"type\": \"ui\" } The name needs to match the name of the microservice. For BFF and SVC microservices, similar files need to be created in the same folder. The same pattern as for the UI applies, just replace microservice with the corresponding product names \"hello-world-bff\" and \"hello-world-svc\" and type to \"bff\" or \"svc\". We also need to add the product definition by creating the following file in imports > product-store > products. The file name must match the product name (here: hello-world). hello-world.json { \"version\": \"xxx\", \"description\": \"hello-world\", \"basePath\": \"/hello-world\", \"displayName\": \"hello-world\", \"iconName\": \"pi-briefcase\" } The basePath defines the URL path where the application will be accessible later. To register the application in the workspace, we can add it to the products array in the onecx_admin.json file located in imports > workspace. onecx_admin.json { \"productName\": \"hello-world\", \"baseUrl\": \"/hello-world\", \"microfrontends\": [ { \"appId\": \"hello-world-ui\", \"basePath\": \"/\" } ] }, The productName, basePath and appId should match the values we used in the files we created before. Now we need to add the container definition for our application by creating a new hello-world.docker-compose.yaml at the same level as the docker-compose.yaml. This file should define the image, environment variables, labels for traefik, network, and profiles. For our Hello World app, it looks like this: hello-world.docker-compose.yaml include: - docker-compose.yaml services: hello-world-ui: image: ${HELLO_WORLD_UI} environment: APP_BASE_HREF: /mfe/helloWorld/ APP_ID: hello-world-ui PRODUCT_NAME: hello-world depends_on: hello-world-bff: condition: service_healthy labels: - traefik.http.services.hello-world-ui.loadbalancer.server.port=8080 - traefik.http.routers.hello-world-ui.rule=Host(`local-proxy`)&&PathPrefix(`/mfe/helloWorld/`) networks: - default profiles: - base - hello-world - hello-world-ui - all The environment variables should match the values we defined in the import files. (APP_BASE_HREF should match remoteBaseUrl in the microfrontend file) The labels section configures traefik for routing. The service will be accessible via port 8080 (the default exposed port for nginx) and the PathPrefix value should match the APP_BASE_HREF. The profiles section specifies which profiles the service can be started with. For further explanation of the profiles see the onecx-local-env documentation.

This allows you to see changes in the application immediately without rebuilding the image. For that we need to adjust the routing configuration in the traefik configurations of the docker image by replacing the labels section of the hello-world-bff service in the hello-world.docker-compose.yaml with the following lines. - \"traefik.http.routers.local_mfe.entrypoints=web\" - \"traefik.http.routers.local_mfe.rule=Host(`local-proxy`)&&PathPrefix(`/mfe/helloWorld/`)\" - \"traefik.http.routers.local_mfe.service=local_mfe@file\" The value of PathPrefix in the traefik label should match the value of APP_BASE_HREF in the environment section of your docker-compose.yaml. Now, routing is handled directly to your locally running application instead of the Docker container. To make sure, that traefik can access the local application, enhance the npm start script in the applications package.json with --host 0.0.0.0 --disable-host-check. Additionally the PROXY_CONFIG in the proxy.config.js of the UI application needs to be updated like this. Note that the path needs to be adjusted according to the PathPrefix value in the traefik label. const PROXY_CONFIG = { '/mfe/helloWorld': { target: 'http://localhost:4200/', secure: false, pathRewrite: { '^.*/mfe/helloWorld': '', }, changeOrigin: true, logLevel: 'debug', bypass: bypassFn, } } If your app runs on the standard port 4200, you can start your application with npm start, restart your containers with docker compose --profile base up -d and every change in the application should be reflected immediately under http://local-proxy/onecx-shell/admin/helloWorld/hello. If your application uses a port other than 4200, you need to first update the port in the url field of the local_mfe service in the ./init-data/traefik/traefik-services.yml file within your onecx-local-env. Set the port to match the one your application is running on. local_mfe: loadBalancer: servers: - url: \"http://host.docker.internal:4200/\" Now you can start your application with npm start and restart your containers with docker compose --profile base up -d. Every change in the application should be reflected immediately under http://local-proxy/onecx-shell/admin/helloWorld/hello. If you want to run multiple applications on different ports, see the Running Multiple Local Apps Simultaneously section. If your local changes are not visible in the OneCX Shell, it could be due to issues with the traefik configurations with the global UI container, that might be still running. To resolve this, stop the container with docker compose stop hello-world-ui, so that only your local container is running. When running your Angular application, you may see the following error in the browser console: hook.js:608 ERROR ReferenceError: ngDevMode is not defined This error occurs when the global variable ngDevMode, which Angular uses to enable development mode features, is missing from the runtime environment. This is often due to Webpack not injecting the variable during the build process. How to fix: To resolve this, ensure that ngDevMode is defined in your Webpack configuration. You can do this by using the DefinePlugin to set the value based on your environment. First set the environment variable in your Dockerfile: ENV NODE_ENV production Then add the following code to the webpack.config.js: const webpack = require('webpack'); const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'; module.exports = { ... plugins: [ new webpack.DefinePlugin({ ngDevMode: JSON.stringify(!isProduction) }), ... ], ... }; And in your package.json scripts, ensure ngDevMode is set as production in build time: \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"nx serve --host 0.0.0.0 --disable-host-check\", \"build\": \"NODE_ENV=production nx build\" } This setup ensures that ngDevMode is correctly defined for both development and production builds, preventing the error.","title":"Enable Hot Reload","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"enable_hot_reload","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-docs-getting-started/first-application/enable_hot_reload.html","titles":[{"text":"Note for different ports","hash":"note-different-ports","id":1},{"text":"Troubleshooting","hash":"troubleshooting","id":2},{"text":"Local Changes are not Visible","hash":"local-changes-not-visible","id":3},{"text":"Angular ngDevMode is not defined Error","hash":"angular-ngdevmode-error","id":4}]},"13":{"id":13,"text":"After setting up the onecx-environment locally, you can begin creating your own application within this environment. This guide walks through the process of building a simple \"Hello World\" Angular app and integrating it into the OneCX environment. To integrate an application into the OneCX environment, it should follow the standard architecture consisting of three main services (ui, bff and svc). These services are consumed by the OneCX shell, which orchestrates and displays the UI components within the broader platform. We start with creating the UI structure of our \"Hello World\" App by running the following commands using the custom OneCX generator. Please check the prerequisites for using the generator before starting. First, we can generate the basic project structure and required files for the application. This includes necessary configuration and build files, initial Angular source code, generated API services, translation assets, Swagger specifications, environment settings and Helm deployment configurations. We can set up the new Angular workspace by running: npx @onecx/create-workspace ngrx hello-world Details to generating a new OneCX Angular workspace can be found here. Navigate into the newly created hello-world directory and install the packages with npm install. Now we want to add a feature module to our application, that encapsulates the functionality of our new feature \"hello\". Therefore a new folder with the name of the feature module will be created in the /src/app/ directory. This will be generated by running the following command: nx generate @onecx/nx-plugin:feature hello Details to generating a feature module can be found here. Additionally we can add a search feature, that includes a table and allows users to search for an item in a certain column. The search page can be generated in the same way as the feature module: nx generate @onecx/nx-plugin:search hello Details to generating a search page can be found here. Now we can also create a details page for the items in the search results by running: nx generate @onecx/nx-plugin:details hello Details to generating a details page can be found here. Additionally we can add a create and update dialog for creating and updating items on the page by running: nx generate @onecx/nx-plugin:create-update hello Details to generating a create-update dialog can be found here. The application can now be built, tested and started by running npm run build, npm run test and npm start. For further customization of the app, you can refer to the general OneCX generator documentation. Now let’s integrate the \"Hello World\" app into the OneCX environment using the onecx-local-env. This section assumes your local environment is already set up and running. In your hello-world UI folder, sync the app with your local environment (adjust the path to your onecx-local-env): npx @onecx/local-env-cli sync ui hello-world /hello-world ./helm/values.yaml -e /path/to/onecx-local-env -n hello-world-ui In this command: hello-world refers to the product name. /hello-world specifies the product’s base path. ./helm/values.yaml is the path to the application’s values.yaml file. -e /path/to/onecx-local-env should be adjusted to the path of your local onecx-local-env repository. -n hello-world-ui specifies the name of the microfrontend service. This command will adjust the files in your onecx-local-env to include the necessary information about the new application’s UI. Add a menu entry for the new application in the OneCX environment by running (adjust the path to your onecx-local-env again): npx @onecx/local-env-cli menu create hello-world-ui /hello-world/hello \"Hello World\" -e /path/to/onecx-local-env This command will create a new menu entry \"Hello World\" under Custom Applications with the path to the applications feature module /hello-world/hello. Add the UI as an image to the docker-compose.yaml of your onecx-local-env with the following command (adjust the path to your onecx-local-env again): npx @onecx/local-env-cli docker hello-world create hello-world helloWorld -e /path/to/onecx-local-env -s ui In this command: - hello-world after docker refers to the name of the custom docker compose that will be created. - hello-world after create references the product name. - helloWorld is the name of the UI path as defined in the values.yaml of the application UI. In this case it is helloWorld as the routing path in the values.yaml is /mfe/helloWorld/. - -e /path/to/onecx-local-env should be adjusted to the path of your local onecx-local-env repository. - -s ui specifies that the service to be added is the UI. Now a hello-world.docker-compose.yaml should be created in the onecx-local-env containing an image for hello-world-ui. More details to the onecx-local-env-cli can be found here. First clone the bff repository: https://github.com/onecx/onecx-hello-world-bff.git and navigate into the folder. As we did for the UI, we can sync the app with your local environment for the bff and add the bff to our hello-world.docker-compose.yaml as well. The src/main/helm/values.yaml path refers to the values.yaml file of the bff. npx @onecx/local-env-cli sync bff hello-world /hello-world src/main/helm/values.yaml -e /path/to/onecx-local-env npx @onecx/local-env-cli docker hello-world create hello-world helloWorld -e /path/to/onecx-local-env -s bff Now we can clone the svc repository: https://github.com/onecx/onecx-hello-world-svc and navigate into the folder. The same way as for the UI and BFF, we can sync the app with your local environment for the svc and add the svc to our hello-world.docker-compose.yaml as well. The src/main/helm/values.yaml path refers to the values.yaml file of the svc. npx @onecx/local-env-cli sync svc hello-world /hello-world src/main/helm/values.yaml -e /path/to/onecx-local-env npx @onecx/local-env-cli docker hello-world create hello-world helloWorld -e /path/to/onecx-local-env -s svc Now that the services are created, the application can be run in the OneCX environment as described here.","title":"Creating a new OneCX Angular App","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"getting_started","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-docs-getting-started/first-application/getting_started.html","titles":[{"text":"General Overview","hash":"general-overview","id":1},{"text":"Creating the UI","hash":"creating-the-ui","id":2},{"text":"1.

To use this approach, first update your hello-world.docker-compose.yaml to use a build section instead of an image reference. Adjust the context to your local app path and reference the application’s Dockerfile as shown in the examples below. For the UI it would look like this: include: - docker-compose.yaml services: hello-world-ui: # image: ${HELLO_WORLD_UI} build: context: /path/to/hello-world-ui dockerfile: Dockerfile environment: APP_BASE_HREF: /mfe/helloWorld/ APP_ID: hello-world-ui PRODUCT_NAME: hello-world depends_on: hello-world-bff: condition: service_healthy labels: - traefik.http.services.hello-world-ui.loadbalancer.server.port=8080 - traefik.http.routers.hello-world-ui.rule=Host(`local-proxy`)&&PathPrefix(`/mfe/helloWorld/`) networks: - default profiles: - base - hello-world - hello-world-ui - all If you want to use the build context for the BFF service, it would look like this: ... hello-world-bff: # image: ${HELLO_WORLD_BFF} build: context: /path/to/hello-world-bff dockerfile: Dockerfile ...

This can be done for the UI, BFF, and SVC. First, go to your application and remove any cache and build folders to avoid using cached images. In the UI you should for example delete the dist folder and nx cache by running the following command: rm -rf .nx/cache ./dist Then you can build your application (e.g. npm run build for the UI) and create a local docker image with e.g.: docker build --no-cache -t hello_world_ui_local . Now in the onecx-local-env navigate to the .env file at the same level as your hello-world.docker-compose.yaml. If the .env file does not exist, please create it first. If you want to use a local image for the UI, the image name for HELLO_WORLD_UI should match the name you used when building the local docker image in your application.

For each app, follow the steps outlined in the hot reloading guide. Note that each app needs to run on a unique port. Make sure the target port specified in the app’s PROXY_CONFIG is different for every app. For each port that is used by an application, you need to add a corresponding entry in the ./init-data/traefik/traefik-services.yml file within your onecx-local-env. This ensures that Traefik can route requests to the correct application based on the port. For that, you can add a new local_mfe2 entry to the services and adjust the port to match the port of your application. For example, if you have two applications running on ports 4200 and 4300, the configuration would look like this: local_mfe: loadBalancer: servers: - url: \"http://host.docker.internal:4200/\" local_mfe2: loadBalancer: servers: - url: \"http://host.docker.internal:4300/\" Also the traefik rules in the docker-compose need to be adjusted to the right local_mfe, so for the second app, you would need to change local_mfe to local_mfe2 in the labels section of the traefik configuration in the hello-world-bff service: - \"traefik.http.routers.local_mfe2.entrypoints=web\" - \"traefik.http.routers.local_mfe2.rule=Host(`local-proxy`)&&PathPrefix(`/mfe/anotherApp/`)\" - \"traefik.http.routers.local_mfe2.service=local_mfe2@file\" Now you can start both applications with npm start in their respective directories and restart your containers with docker compose --profile base up -d.

We first need to define our application, microservice, Ui Component and register the application in our workspace. There are two main approaches to add the necessary data. You can either create the import files and update the container definitions manually, or you can use the onecx-local-env-cli to automate the process. The recommended method depends on how your application was created: If you used the OneCX generator as outlined in the Getting Started guide, you can quickly set up your application using the onecx-local-env-cli.

The goal is to provide a comprehensive and scalable approach to securing applications in modern web environments. The Security & Permissions system leverages Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions based on user roles, allowing for fine-grained access control across various resources and endpoints. Integration with identity providers such as Keycloak or other OpenID Connect (OIDC) compliant systems ensures secure user authentication. The system verifies user credentials and assigns appropriate roles according to predefined rules. For every request, the BFF performs permission validation to confirm that the user has the necessary access rights to the requested resource, preventing unauthorized users from bypassing security measures. Additionally, the BFF enforces access control for microservices by evaluating user permissions and applying security policies at the API level. This centralized security logic simplifies the management of roles and permissions, ensuring consistent security policies throughout the application and eliminating the need to replicate logic across different services.

This means that the individual microfrontends are loaded separately and are joined into one website inside the browser of the user. This integration is done by the OneCX Shell. OneCX Apps can expose two kinds of mircofrontends: RemoteComponents: These are reusable parts of the website which are independently loaded from the current URL inside a workspace e.g. the menu. Microfrontends: These are parts of the website which are loaded depending on the current URL and loaded into the main area of the website. The OneCX Shell is responsible for the client-site integration and crosscutting support tasks for the microfrontends. The OneCX Shell is free of business logic. The support tasks of the OneCX Shell are for example: Handling of authentication Loading microfrontends at the correct point in time and displaying them at the correct location Providing information about Workspace configuration Currently loaded microfrontend User profile User permissions Theme Displaying toast messages The image above shows a schematic drawing of the layout of the default shell. All boxes besides the box labeled Microfrontend are so called slots in OneCX. Slots are named areas in the layout of the shell which can be configured to contain one or more RemoteComponents. In the box labeled Microfrontend the shell loads the microfrontend depending on the URL and URL changes. The configuration which RemoteComponent is loaded where and which microfrontend is loaded for which URL is configured inside the workspace definition which is loaded on startup of the shell based on the URL the user has opened. The OneCX Shell assumes the following layout of the URL: <protocol>://<host>[:<port>]/[<path to the shell>/]<workspace name>/<microfrontend path>/<path inside the microfrontend> <path to the shell>: This is the path under which the shell itself is reachable. It can be empty if the OneCX shell is hosted on top-level of the domain. <workspace name>: This is the configured name of the workspace definition and identifies the workspace the shell should load on startup. <microfrontend path>: This is the path prefix of a configured microfrontend inside a workspace. The OneCX Shell loads and unloads microfrontends inside the box labeled Microfrontend based on this path prefix. <path inside the microfrontend>: This is the part of the URL the microfrontend itself can use to control which page inside the microfrontend is shown. This is the part of the path the application developer is responsible for. As mentioned above the OneCX shell communicates with the RemoteComponents and Microfrontends. This cannot be done via shared memory inside a library because it con not be guaranteed that each part of the website uses the same version and instance of a library. There are in general two ways to solve this issue: Usage shared memory inside the browser window. This makes it hard to version the communication, react to value changes and to garbage collect. Usage of messages/events on bowser window level. OneCX offers a versioned decentralized publish and subscribe mechanism inside the browser window. This mechanism is used to communicate information between the parts of the website. The OneCX Shell is using it to offer its integration interface to the apps. When discussing Microfrontend loading mechanisms the way how to expose the microfrontend for loading is an important factor. There are two expose microfrontends in OneCX context: Angular lazy loaded modules WebComponents aka Custom Elements The way, how a microfrontend is loaded has to be configured when registering a microfrontend in OneCX. It is NOT recommended to use the Angular expose method. Doing so restrains the platform from using many frameworks with different versions, which means that all Microfrontends would need to use the same technology and version as the OneCX shell. OneCX platform uses Module Federation technology integrated with webpack to expose and load Microfrontends.

Core Architecture Principles Microservices- and microfrontend-based architecture: The platform is composed of independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Backend for frontend (BFF): OneCX proposes and uses the backend for frontend pattern for communication between frontend and backend. API-first design: RESTful APIs are used for communication between the frontend and backend, as well as between microservices. Containerization and CI/CD: Services are containerized using Docker, and the project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment. Cloud-native architecture: Services are designed to be deployed in cloud environments with Kubernetes for orchestration, ensuring easy scaling and high availability. To reduce testing and deployment complexity OneCX uses a concept called application. An application is a versioned bundle of frontends, BFFs, backends. The parts of an application are called apps. An application contains all system parts of a specific subdomain (e.g. user management). The testing and deployment are always done for a complete application. This reduces the effort because it reduces the possible permutations which must be considered. In OneCX a workspace is a set of settings for a portal for a subset of the users or for a special purpose, e.g. there could be a workspace focusing on administrating the system or one focusing on sales. The number of workspaces in the system is not limited. A workspace contains the following settings: Name Path to identify the workspace from the URL Theme Menu List of selected applications from the pool of available applications with Path inside the workspace Slot configuration","title":"OneCX Architecture Overview","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"index","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-docs-overview/architecture-overview/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Applications","hash":"applications","id":1},{"text":"Workspaces","hash":"workspaces","id":2}]},"25":{"id":25,"text":"A Microfrontend is a OneCX App, often considered as a UI App, which is a part of the OneCX Application. It is responsible for exposing modules and Remote Components via a remote entry file that can be used by other UI Apps. The difference between the standard UI application and a Microfrontend is that Microfrontend is never accessed directly, but instead used by the host application. To precisely explain the purpose of using Microfrontends, it is crucial to become familiar with the client-side perspective of each Microfrontend. As previously stated, each Microfrontend is exposing a remote entry file that can be accessed by any UI App. This remote entry file should contain all the data required to display the desired pieces of user interface. In the context of OneCX platform, this file should expose the following types of content: Module: During workspace construction, the Shell creates routing rules and associates a module, from the remote entry file, with a specific route. Whenever a user navigates to that route, the module is loaded using the remote entry file to display desired content in the content pane of the page. Remote Component: A component exposed via remote entry file is loaded onto a page on demand using Slot Component. Module type is suited for displaying whole UI modules containing many pages and its own routing rules, whereas Remote Component is suited for smaller pieces of UI, which are easily replaceable and reusable within the platform. It is important to know that Remote Components and Modules are both exposed via a Microfrontend through a remote entry file. More on the topic of Remote Components can be found here. The main reason for using the Microfrontends approach is to allow teams to develop user interfaces in a scaled agile manner. It is best suited for large organizations that want to create user interfaces using many independent teams. In such cases, it is not possible to develop a UI monolith application efficiently. With the Microfrontends approach, OneCX platform is delivering a solution to allow those teams to work on their own pieces of user interfaces while preserving a common ground and allowing them to easily integrate with each other. In OneCX platform context, a Microfrontend is part of the Application which can be integrated using OneCX Core Applications in a matter of seconds and customized depending on the users needs. Each Microfrontend is independent of others and can be responsible for a subset of the functionalities needed for the organization. The technical details of the displayed content within a Module or Remote Component exposed via Microfrontend are only relevant for the developers responsible for that Application. The mechanism of displaying Microfrontend’s content dynamically in OneCX platform context is related to the content type and expose method. In the previous section, differences between content types were explained. In terms of the expose method, there are 2 options: Angular: Angular components and modules are exposed. Webcomponent: Components and modules are wrapped as Web Components and then exposed. It is NOT recommended to use the Angular expose method. Doing so restrains the platform from using many frameworks with different versions, which means that all Microfrontends would need to use the same technology and version.

OneCX Remote Component is a piece of user interface representing a single UI component exposed via a remote entry file by a single Microfrontend. With OneCX platform the go-to method for exposing complete user interfaces is to expose complete modules via Microfrontend’s remote entry file. However, there might be cases in which some components developed within one Application might be useful for other Applications. The concept of Remote Components extends the concept of Microfrontends by focusing on both scaled agile and reusability. A Remote Component will always be owned by a specific Microfrontend, but can be used in any desired place (Shell, Microfrontend’s module, another Remote Component). The mechanism of Remote Components display will make more sense once OneCX Slots are explained. The implementation details of a Remote Component are located in a specific Microfrontend’s source code. The client side of that Remote Component does not need to prepare additional technical code, which means that they are implemented once and maintained in a single place. With Remote Components it is easy to share the technical implementation details from one Application to another. For example, Remote Components might come in handy when your Applications require the ability to change the current user’s password via a button. In that scenario, the User Profile UI would expose a Remote Component that implements such functionality, and other Applications with that requirement would use it in the desired place to allow users to change their password. Technical details on how the password change is handled would be in a single place, and all Applications using the Remote Component will not need to take care of that matter. Every Remote Component requires a host to be displayed within a page. OneCX Slots are the elements fulfilling this role. To use a Remote Component it is necessary to first implement and expose it via a Microfrontend remote entry file and then create and confiure a OneCX Slot in which it should be displayed. OneCX Slot is a standard component used in the HTML content templates. It uses current workspace information to determine what content should be loaded inside the Slot. Slots themselves do not have any content, and their only purpose is to render Remote Components that are assigned to them. With OneCX Slots it is easy to reuse components and dynamically change the content displayed on the pages. Whenever it is desired to display a Remote Component, a Slot is needed to act as a host element for it. For OneCX Core Applications, there are existing Slots, which can be used to configure displayed content (especially Shell Application’s Slots). To create a Slot the following requirements have to be fulfilled: Register Slot in Application Store: Slot needs to be registered via the Application Store. Use Slot in HTML template: Slot needs to be used in the HTML template of Microfrontend’s content. Unique name: Slot requires having a unique name property to be recognizable. To assign a Remote Component to a Slot the following requirements have to be fulfilled: Prerequisites Slot has to be created. A Remote Component has to be exposed by the provider Application’s Microfrontend. Both provider and consumer Application need to be registered for a Workspace. Register Slot in Workspace: Slot needs to be registered for a Workspace that will be using it via Workspace Management. Assign Remote Component to Slot: a Remote Component needs to be assigned to a Slot for a Workspace that will be using it via Workspace Management. Modules exposed by a Microfrontend are loaded by the Shell Application’s UI App using routing rules. With Remote Components this responsibility is on OneCX Slot. Here is a quick overview of steps happening when Remote Components are being loaded: On initial page load, Shell UI gathers Remote Components and Slots data and passes it to a Topic. Slot Component: is rendered within a page. reads the data passed down via a Topic and fills out its content. checks for registered Remote Components. creates Remote Components and renders them inside itself. runs the initialization function of each Remote Component. listens to Input and Output changes and passes the data to registered Remote Components.

It’s the most important OneCX core Application that glues together all Applications and makes the platform seem like a single page application. Without the Shell running, there will be nothing for users to use. Below is a list of apps the Shell Application consists of: UI - user interface app which renders the platform overlay and is responsible for routing between applications BFF - backend for frontend app connecting with OneCX core applications SVCs to construct workspaces The Shell Application is a special case of OneCX Application. It is a host for Microfrontends within the platform. The list of its responsibilities is the following: client-side workspace construction routing and remotes loading workspace and user data sharing OneCX platform is operating on the idea of workspaces. Each workspace can have many applications registered and can be customized to its users' needs via custom menu configuration, page theming and many more possibilities. To construct a valid workspace, the following operations happen: Shell BFF gathers workspace information. Data required to construct a valid workspace to function on the platform is saved in several databases. These can be reached using the backend services of OneCX Core Applications. Shell BFF connects with them and gathers all required information in a single response. Shell UI constructs routing rules for a given workspace based on the data fetched by Shell BFF. When Shell UI is finished with workspace construction, its next responsibility is to react to routing changes and load Microfrontends' exposed modules into the page. To achieve that, Shell UI App is using @angular-architects/module-federation, which allows loading remote entries at runtime. In this way, on a valid routing operation, the Shell UI App will load the exposed Microfrontend’s module and display it in the content pane of the page. Shell is responsible for loading Microfrontend’s modules only. To learn more, please refer to the Microfrontend content loading document. When Shell UI App receives the workspace and current user data from the backend, it makes sure that this data is available for any Microfrontend’s content. This data is passed on by the Shell UI App to Topics. A Topic is a similar concept to an Observable, but it can be used to pass data between the UI Apps using browser memory. It is a concept implemented in OneCX. A more in-depth explanation of it can be found here. For Angular-based Microfrontends, services in the @onecx/angular-integration-interface package might be useful during the development. They are operating on Topics that contain information passed along by the Shell UI App. Having data in browser memory via Topics gives Microfrontend’s content direct access to information about the workspace and current user. Information passed on by the Shell UI App contains the following information: details of current workspace Remote Components and Slots registered for the current workspace the current user’s personal information, settings (such as language or locale), permissions currently accessed Application data (information available after Application’s Microfrontend gets loaded) Any Microfrontend’s content can then utilize this data and act on it with the possibility to react to data changes.

This process typically includes creating the necessary directories, installing dependencies, and configuring the build tools to ensure that the Microfrontend can run independently and integrate with other Microfrontends or a shell application. This document aims to explain the details related to Microfrontend’s content bootstrapping. Depending on the content’s type and expose method, there are different requirements needed to be fulfilled to ensure the content is loaded correctly by OneCX platform elements. This topic is highly related to Microfrontend content loading and Microfrontend configuration with Webpack. It is recommended to be familiar with those before reading this document. Microfrontend content loading is an action triggered by the route change (Shell Application’s responsibility of loading modules) or by the Slot Component display (Slot Component’s responsibility of loading Remote Components). During this action, Microfrontend’s content, exposed via remote entry file, is loaded and bootstrapped using the provided file in Webpack configuration. Depending on the content type and chosen expose method, different adjustments have to be made to ensure correct content bootstrapping. It is NOT recommended to use the Angular expose method. Doing so restrains the platform from using many frameworks with different versions, which means that all Microfrontends would need to use the same technology and version. When exposing modules and Remote Components using the Angular method, there are two requirements: Webpack configuration needs to expose the module or component file directly. It means that instead of pointing to a main.ts file that is bootstrapping the content, module.ts and component.ts files should be used directly. The main.ts file of Microfrontend’s modules (content type) needs to bootstrap the module asynchronously. main.ts content should look similar to: import('./bootstrap').catch(err => console.error(err)); bootstrap.ts content should look similar to (or any custom bootstrap of your Microfrontend): import { AppModule } from './app/app.module'; import { environment } from './environments/environment'; import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic'; import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core'; if (environment.production) { enableProdMode(); } platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule) .catch(err => console.error(err)); Loading mechanism for modules and Remote Components exposed using Webcomponent method requires that content is adapted to using Web Components Custom Elements. For both content types, bootstrapping logic needs to register a Custom Element in the Custom Elements Registry. For Angular-based content, apart from Custom Element registration, it is also required to cover a few Angular-related issues. For more information on those issues, please refer here. It is recommended to use the @onecx/angular-webcomponents library to bootstrap Microfrontend’s content using its exposed methods. This library will be used in the examples throughout this document. The following requirements need to be fulfilled when exposing modules using the Webcomponent method: Webpack configuration needs to expose the main.ts file of the module. The main.ts file of the module needs to bootstrap the module asynchronously. Module bootstrapping has to cover Angular issues (for Angular-based modules only) Module class needs to register an entry point as a Custom Element in the Custom Elements Registry. needs to adapt routing so Shell registers routing happening within the module. needs to adapt configuration, so services are using correct URLs to external resources. Below, a module setup example (Angular-based) for using the Webcomponent expose method is presented. Each file’s content is going to be explained in detail, with important context information for technologies other than those presented. webpack.config.js const config = withModuleFederationPlugin({ name: 'example-ui', filename: 'remoteEntry.js', exposes: { './ExampleModule': './src/main.ts' }, ... }) Webpack configuration is exposing a main.ts file. src/main.ts import('./bootstrap').catch((err) => console.error(err)) The main.ts file is importing (asynchronously) the bootstrap.ts file. src/bootstrap.ts import { bootstrapModule } from '@onecx/angular-webcomponents' import { environment } from './environments/environment' import { ExampleModule } from './app/module' bootstrapModule(ExampleModule, 'microfrontend', environment.production) The bootstrap.ts file is bootstrapping the module using @onecx/angular-webcomponents library to ensure that Angular ngZone and platform are shared (Angular requirement only). For other technologies, simply call any asynchronous bootstrap function required. src/app/module.ts import { HttpClient, provideHttpClient, withInterceptorsFromDi } from '@angular/common/http' import { APP_INITIALIZER, DoBootstrap, Injector, NgModule } from '@angular/core' import { Router, RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router' import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser' import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations' import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common' import { MissingTranslationHandler, TranslateLoader, TranslateModule } from '@ngx-translate/core' import { AppStateService, ConfigurationService, createTranslateLoader, PortalCoreModule, PortalMissingTranslationHandler, PortalApiConfiguration, } from '@onecx/portal-integration-angular' import { AngularAuthModule } from '@onecx/angular-auth' import { createAppEntrypoint, initializeRouter, startsWith } from '@onecx/angular-webcomponents' import { addInitializeModuleGuard } from '@onecx/angular-integration-interface' import { Configuration } from './shared/generated' @Component({ selector: 'app-root', template: `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` }) export class AppEntrypointComponent {} export const routes: Routes = [ { matcher: startsWith(''), loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then((mod) => mod.FeatureModule) }, { matcher: startsWith('tracking'), loadChildren: () => import('./tracking/tracking.module').then((mod) => mod.TrackingModule) } ] function apiConfigProvider(configService: ConfigurationService, appStateService: AppStateService) { return new PortalApiConfiguration(Configuration, environment.apiPrefix, configService, appStateService) } @NgModule({ declarations: [AppEntrypointComponent], imports: [ CommonModule, PortalCoreModule.forMicroFrontend(), RouterModule.forRoot(addInitializeModuleGuard(routes)), TranslateModule.forRoot({ extend: true, isolate: false, loader: { provide: TranslateLoader, useFactory: createTranslateLoader, deps: [HttpClient, AppStateService] }, missingTranslationHandler: { provide: MissingTranslationHandler, useClass: PortalMissingTranslationHandler } }), BrowserModule, AngularAuthModule, BrowserAnimationsModule, ], exports: [], providers: [ { provide: Configuration, useFactory: apiConfigProvider, deps: [ConfigurationService, AppStateService] }, { provide: APP_INITIALIZER, useFactory: initializeRouter, multi: true, deps: [Router, AppStateService] }, provideHttpClient(withInterceptorsFromDi()) ] }) export class ExampleModule implements DoBootstrap { constructor(private readonly injector: Injector) {} ngDoBootstrap(): void { createAppEntrypoint(AppEntrypointComponent, 'example-webcomponent', this.injector) } } The module.ts file prepares the module for integration with the OneCX platform. This example showcases the recommended approach of defining modules (Angular-based) using the Webcomponent method. Here is a list of important features of this example: Module imports CommonModule, BrowserModule and BrowserAnimationsModule Angular modules used for adding functionality to the module. PortalCoreModule is defined to allow usage of OneCX components and services. TranslateModule is defined to allow translations using translation keys within the module. AngularAuthModule is defined to use OneCX authorization mechanisms. RouterModule is defined for routing to feature modules within the exposed module. Entrypoint component AppEntrypoint is a standard Angular component that has a <router-outlet> element in its template. The createAppEntrypoint registers AppEntrypointComponent in the Custom Elements Registry, so anytime '<example-webcomponent>' is rendered, AppEntrypointComponent should be instantiated. The third parameter, being the module’s Injector, is very important. This injector will be used by the instances of AppEntrypointComponent rendered using Web Components technology, meaning that each instance will have everything related to the module already set up. That also means the <router-outlet> will be using routes defined for the module. The createAppEntrypoint method is also responsible for connecting the module’s router to the Shell’s router. Every time the URL of the browser changes, the Shell is going to publish a new message, via EventsTopic, with information about the new URL. The createAppEntrypoint method subscribes to the EventsTopic and updates the router state accordingly to the received information. For technologies other than Angular, it is recommended to: register a Custom Element in the Custom Elements Registry. provide dependencies to registered Custom Element according to the module. listen to EventsTopic data changes and update the state of the module’s routing. Routes matching Each defined route will load a feature module whenever it is activated. Because the Webcomponent expose method causes multiple routers to exist at the same time (Shell has its own router and every module or Remote Component displayed at a single point in time can have their own), an adjustment to the routes definition has to be made. The idea of routing in this example is the following: User enters 'shell_url/workspace_name/example_base_path' URL - FeatureModule is used. User enters 'shell_url/workspace_name/example_base_path/tracking' URL - TrackingModule is used. With the following URL parts meaning: shell_url - the Shell Application deployment URL, e.g. localhost:4200/shell. workspace_name - name of the accessed Workspace, e.g. admin. example_base_path - base path of the example Microfrontend (configured via OneCX Core Applications), e.g. example. Prior to routing within Microfrontend’s module, the Shell uses shell_url, workspace_name and example_base_path parts of the URL to load the module. Because of this fact, the module’s router needs to remove those parts from consideration when matching its routes. Usually, the path property of the route is used to control the route activation, but in that case, the Microfrontend’s module needs a way to only match the relevant part of the URL. Using the startsWith function from @onecx/angular-webcomponents for the matcher property of a route object results in the router considering only those URL parts relevant to the module. In order for it to work properly, the initializeRouter provider has to be added for the module as an app initializer. During module creation initializeRouter: adds Microfrontend information (based on CurrentMfeTopic) to each route. rewrites routes containing redirectTo for correct redirection. creates a new route (used when routing away from the module): matched when none of the defined routes were matched. displays nothing (for a period of time when the user routes between Microfrontends). The startsWith method uses Microfrontend information, saved in the route’s data, to remove already used parts from consideration when matching routes within the module. To create your own matchers, please consider using the @onecx/angular-webcomponents library. For technologies other than Angular, it is recommended to: Use Microfrontend information from CurrentMfeTopic to only use relevant parts of the URL for routing and redirecting correctly. Ensure routing away from the module is not causing side effects. Configuration All services utilizing HttpClient used within the Microfrontend’s module need to know how to make requests to external resources. Depending on the configuration of the Workspace, they need to take that context into consideration when creating a URL for those resources. A service might want to call deployment_url/bff/search by default. With this call being made, the MFE App will need to access the BFF. When the Application’s path within the Workspace is mfe/example the call has to be made to deployment_url/mfe/example/bff/search. The apiConfigProvider presented in the example is utilizing the PortalApiConfiguration class as Configuration for the services. It is listening for the CurrentMfeTopic changes and overwriting the basePath accordingly to the received message, and all services use that information to construct a valid URL. For technologies other than Angular, it is recommended to: Listen to CurrentMfeTopic changes and overwrite services configuration to ensure the correct resource is accessed. The following requirements need to be fulfilled when exposing Remote Components using the Webcomponent method: Webpack configuration needs to expose the main.ts file of the Remote Component. The main.ts file of the Remote Component needs to bootstrap the component asynchronously. Component bootstrap has to cover Angular issues (for Angular-based Remote Components only). needs to register the component as a Custom Element in the Custom Elements Registry. needs to adapt routing so Shell registers routing happening within the Remote Component. Component class needs to use the Remote Component initialization mechanism. Below is an example of setting up a Remote Component in Angular using the Webcomponent expose method. Each file’s content is going to be explained in detail, with important context information for technologies other than those presented. webpack.config.js const config = withModuleFederationPlugin({ name: 'example-ui', filename: 'remoteEntry.js', exposes: { './ExampleComponent': './src/app/remotes/example/example.component.main.ts' }, ... }) Webpack configuration is exposing an example.component.main.ts file. src/app/remotes/example/example.component.main.ts import('./example.component.bootstrap').catch((err) => console.error(err)) The example.component.main.ts file is importing (asynchronously) the example.component.bootstrap.ts file. src/app/remotes/example/example.component.bootstrap.ts import { HttpClient, provideHttpClient, withInterceptorsFromDi, } from '@angular/common/http'; import { APP_INITIALIZER, importProvidersFrom } from '@angular/core'; import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser'; import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations'; import { AngularAuthModule } from '@onecx/angular-auth'; import { bootstrapRemoteComponent } from '@onecx/angular-webcomponents'; import { createRemoteComponentTranslateLoader, UserService } from '@onecx/portal-integration-angular'; import { environment } from 'src/environments/environment'; import { ExampleComponent } from './example.component'; import { BASE_URL, provideTranslateServiceForRoot, } from '@onecx/angular-remote-components'; import { TranslateLoader } from '@ngx-translate/core'; import { ReplaySubject } from 'rxjs'; function userProfileInitializer(userService: UserService) { return async () => { await userService.isInitialized; }; } bootstrapRemoteComponent( ExampleComponent, 'example-remote-component', environment.production, [ provideHttpClient(withInterceptorsFromDi()), { provide: BASE_URL, useValue: new ReplaySubject<string>(1), }, provideTranslateServiceForRoot({ isolate: true, loader: { provide: TranslateLoader, useFactory: createRemoteComponentTranslateLoader, deps: [HttpClient, BASE_URL], }, }), importProvidersFrom( AngularAuthModule, BrowserModule, BrowserAnimationsModule, ), { provide: APP_INITIALIZER, useFactory: userProfileInitializer, deps: [UserService], multi: true, }, ] ) The example.component.bootstrap.ts file is bootstrapping the Remote Component using @onecx/angular-webcomponents library to ensure that Angular ngZone and platform are shared (Angular requirement only). It also connects the Shell router with the Remote Component’s router (if such exists). The last argument is an array of providers required for the component to work properly. A detailed description of this file can be found in the [summary]. src/app/remotes/example/example.component.ts import { CommonModule, Location } from '@angular/common'; import { Component, Inject, Input } from '@angular/core'; import { TranslateModule, TranslateService } from '@ngx-translate/core'; import { AngularAuthModule } from '@onecx/angular-auth'; import { UserService } from '@onecx/angular-integration-interface'; import { AngularRemoteComponentsModule, BASE_URL, ocxRemoteComponent, ocxRemoteWebcomponent, RemoteComponentConfig, } from '@onecx/angular-remote-components'; import { PortalCoreModule } from '@onecx/portal-integration-angular'; import { ReplaySubject } from 'rxjs'; import { environment } from 'src/environments/environment' @NgModule({ imports: [ PortalCoreModule.forMicroFrontend() ] }) export class SharedModule {} @Component({ standalone: true, imports: [ AngularAuthModule, AngularRemoteComponentsModule, CommonModule, SharedModule, PortalCoreModule, TranslateModule, ], selector: 'example-comp', template: `<h>Hello from Remote Component</h>`, }) export class ExampleComponent implements ocxRemoteComponent, ocxRemoteWebcomponent { permissions: string[] = []; constructor( @Inject(BASE_URL) private readonly baseUrl: ReplaySubject<string>, private readonly userService: UserService, private readonly translateService: TranslateService, private readonly exampleService: ExampleAPIService ) { this.translateService.use(this.userService.lang$.getValue()); } @Input() set ocxRemoteComponentConfig(config: RemoteComponentConfig) { this.ocxInitRemoteComponent(config); } ocxInitRemoteComponent(config: RemoteComponentConfig): void { this.baseUrl.next(config.baseUrl); this.permissions = config.permissions; this.exampleService.configuration = new Configuration({ basePath: Location.joinWithSlash(config.baseUrl, environment.apiPrefix) }) } } The example.component.ts file prepares the Remote Component for integration with the OneCX platform. This example showcases the recommended approach to define Remote Components (Angular-based) using the Webcomponent method. Here is a list of important features of this example: Component bootstrap Remote Components are better suited for integration with the Web Components Custom Elements concept. The biggest reason for this is that a Remote Component already represents a component, meaning that there is no need to define any additional entry point component (like what was done for module content type). The bootstrapRemoteComponent method is bootstrapping the Remote Component. It is responsible for: Creating application As a first step, the bootstrapRemoteComponent method is going to create an Angular application. The created application will use defined providers (argument of bootstrapRemoteComponent). In this example, the following providers are defined: HttpClient (via provideHttpClient) - used for making HTTP calls. TranslateService (via provideTranslateServiceForRoot) - used for making translations via translation keys. providers from AngularAuthModule - OneCX authorization mechanisms. providers from BrowserModule. providers from BrowserAnimationsModule. APP_INITIALIZER using userProfileInitializer factory function - in ExampleComponent’s constructor, the this.userService.lang$.getValue() call is made to set TranslationService language. Since that call is synchronous, it is important to ensure that UserService has been initialized before fetching its data. Providers passed in the xref:webcomponents.adoc#bootstrap-remote-componentbootstrapRemoteComponent method call should contain any providers required by the Remote Component. Any services or injection tokens have to be defined here. It is important that those providers are aligned with imports defined via the Remote Component’s definition. Depending on the Remote Component, different providers and imports will be defined. The created application is going to have an Injector (just like a module does). This Injector will be used by the instance of ExampleComponent rendered using Web Components technology. For Angular-based Remote Components, it is recommended to use bootstrapRemoteComponent and define every required provider as an argument of this method. This approach will ensure that the rendered component has all required services, tokens, etc. already set up. Fixing Angular issues (Angular requirement only) The bootstrapRemoteComponent method takes care of ngZone and platform sharing. Connecting router The bootstrapRemoteComponent method is responsible for connecting the Remote Component’s router to the Shell’s router (if there is one defined), so their states are always the same. The connection is set up in the same way as for the module’s router. Registering the Custom Element The bootstrapRemoteComponent method registers the ExampleComponent in the Custom Elements Registry, so anytime <example-remote-component> is rendered, ExampleComponent should be instantiated. For technologies other than Angular, it is recommended to: register a Custom Element in the Custom Elements Registry. provide dependencies to registered Custom Element according to the Remote Component. listen for EventsTopic data changes and update the state of the Remote Component’s routing (if routing is used). Component definition and configuration For Angular-based components, any Remote Component is required to be a standalone Angular component. The component’s import array’s purpose is to declare all required dependencies, just like for Angular modules. It is recommended to import: AngularAuthModule for authorization mechanisms. CommonModule for common Angular functionalities. SharedModule with PortalCoreModule.forMicroFrontend() import for allowing OneCX components and services usage. PortalCoreModule so the component recognizes OneCX components and services. TranslateModule for translations mechanism. AngularRemoteComponentsModule. In the example.component.bootstrap.ts, some providers related to those dependencies were already declared in the bootstrapRemoteComponent method call. For technologies other than Angular, it is recommended to: define the component so that all dependencies are provided. Configuration and initialization The ExampleComponent implements two interfaces: ocxRemoteComponent - requires component to define ocxInitRemoteComponent method ocxRemoteWebcomponent - requires component to define ocxRemoteComponentConfig property For Webcomponent method, it is required to implement ocxRemoteWebcomponent, but optional to implement ocxRemoteComponent. The ocxRemoteComponentConfig is set by the Remote Component’s Slot Component after the Remote Component’s element is created in the HTML. The value that is set is of type RemoteComponentConfig structure. On receiving the configuration, the Remote Component should: update BASE_URL. update permissions (if permissions are used). update the base URL of its services (if services that require external calls are used). Table 1. RemoteComponentConfig structure Property Type Description appId string Unique identifier of the Microfrontend Remote Component is part of. productName string Name of the Application currently Remote Component is part of. permissions string[] Current user permissions related to the Remote Component’s Microfrontend. baseUrl string URL of Remote Component’s Microfrontend to be used when accessing its content (remote entry file, assets, etc.), e.g. '/mfe/mfe_name'. For technologies other than Angular, it is recommended to: implement the component so the ocxRemoteComponentConfig property is defined, and whenever it is set: the component’s resources or the component itself will use the correct baseUrl to access external resources. permission checking mechanisms will use provided permissions.","title":"OneCX Microfrontend Content Bootstrapping","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"bootstrapping","url":"/documentation/current/implementation-details/bootstrapping.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"overview","id":1},{"text":"Microfrontend Content Bootstrapping Explained","hash":"microfrontend-content-bootstrapping-explained","id":2},{"text":"Content Exposed Using Angular Method","hash":"content-exposed-using-angular-method","id":3},{"text":"Content Exposed Using Webcomponent Method","hash":"content-exposed-using-webcomponent-method","id":4},{"text":"Module Bootstrapping and Configuration","hash":"module-bootstrapping-and-configuration","id":5},{"text":"Remote Module Example Deep Dive","hash":"remote-module-example-deep-dive","id":6},{"text":"Remote Component Bootstrapping and Configuration","hash":"remote-component-bootstrapping-and-configuration","id":7},{"text":"Remote Component Example Deep Dive","hash":"remote-component-example-deep-dive","id":8}]},"30":{"id":30,"text":"This section of the documentation aims to explain some of the technical implementation details of OneCX platform.

Those factors are: content type Module Remote Component expose method Angular Webcomponent All of them are dependent on the Application Microfrontend’s content that is meant to be integrated with OneCX platform. Please make sure to properly configure each integrated Application in the Application Store. It is NOT recommended to use the Angular expose method. Doing so restrains the platform from using many frameworks with different versions, which means that all Microfrontends would need to use the same technology and version. OneCX platform uses Module Federation technology integrated with Webpack to expose and load Microfrontends. To find out more about how Module Federation enables Microfrontends, please refer here. In the context of content loading, content type determines which mechanism will be responsible for loading. Module loading will be handled by the Shell UI router via constructed routing rules, and Remote Component loading will be handled by the Slot Component (to which the Remote Component has been assigned). When dealing with modules, Shell UI is responsible for loading them. As explained in the Shell overview, Shell UI first constructs workspace and then handles routing and loading of remotes. Workspace configuration contains all valid routes to Applications registered for a given workspace, each route associated with a Microfrontend’s module. Prior to any routing events, the Shell UI initializes the router to reflect workspace configuration. Based on the data from backend services about the current workspace, Shell UI creates routing rules to use during the runtime. Let’s take a workspace using a User Profile Application as an example. Each Application in the workspace configuration has to have a path defined. This path is used for routing and accessing the remote entry file of the Application’s Microfrontend. Assuming the path is /user, Shell UI will create a routing rule specifying that whenever url of the page changes to one starting with /user it has to load the Microfrontend’s module. After routing rules are successfully created, each registered Application should have a route registered in Shell UI’s router. Each route has a loadChildren method, which is called whenever a route gets activated, but it also has additional properties that are used by the shell during routing. The loadChildren method is responsible for loading the remote module into the Shell UI’s memory using @angular-architects/module-federation. When the remote module is loaded successfully, it is used by the router to display the module’s content in the content pane of the page. Remote Component loading is handled by the Slot Component. The overall mechanism of Remote Component loading was explained in the Remote Components documentation. In the context of content loading, it’s important to note the following aspects: The Remote Component loading process starts when a Slot Component is rendered on a page. Remote Component exposed content is loaded via @angular-architects/module-federation (similar to module content type). Then, once it’s loaded successfully, it is rendered onto a page within the Slot Component via a dynamic content creation mechanism dependent on the chosen expose method. Expose method is a factor that is taken into consideration by the respective loading mechanism (Shell UI router or Slot Component) to ensure correct content loading. For module loading, the loadChildren method and router configuration are impacted. For Remote Component loading, a different mechanism of dynamic content creation is chosen. For information on specific expose method impacts, please refer to the following documents: Webcomponent method Independent on the content type and expose method, OneCX platform will load exposed content using Module Federation. During this step, exposed content is loaded using the file specified in the webpack configuration for the respective content. Such configuration is usually located in the webpack.config.js file. In the code snippet below, the ./src/main.ts file would be used for the module and the ./src/app/remotes/my-comp/my-comp.component.main.ts file for Remote Component loading. const config = withModuleFederationPlugin({ name: 'my-application-ui', filename: 'remoteEntry.js', exposes: { './MyDefaultModule': './src/main.ts', './MyRemoteComponent': './src/app/remotes/my-comp/my-comp.component.main.ts' }, ... }) Those files should contain code that takes care of all the setup required to display the content. Depending on the chosen expose method, the code in those files will vary.

In the OneCX context, they are useful for dynamic content creation for both modules and the display of Remote Components in Microfrontends. Prior to reading this document, it is recommended to read the documentation of microfrontend content loading to get familiar with the content loading mechanisms available within the OneCX platform. Webcomponent expose method enables the OneCX platform to use UI Apps developed with different frameworks and versions. It is the recommended method for all Applications. Web Components technologies are used within OneCX platform. However, OneCX offers its own functionalities that should be used to expose Microfrontend’s content using the Webcomponent expose method. Those functionalities are based on Web Components technologies, so there is no need to get familiar with them. Nevertheless, more resources about Web Components can be found here Web Components are used in OneCX context for dynamic content creation. OneCX platform uses Web Components technologies to bound UI components to HTML elements. OneCX platform will use information from the Application Store to determine what HTML elements have to be rendered to allow certain modules and Remote Components to be bound to page content. With Webcomponent expose method, the OneCX platform is only loading the code required for Microfrontend’s content into the Shell UI memory and creating a \"host\" element for Remote Components or modules to attach to using Web Components. The Microfrontend’s exposed content is partially responsible for the content creation. Microfrontends have to adapt exposed modules and components, so they are using Web Components Custom Elements. Custom Elements are part of the Web Components technology. It is a set of tools used to achieve the bounding between components and HTML elements. As mentioned, OneCX platform will create HTML elements specified via configuration whenever a module or Remote Component has to be displayed on a page. There are 2 steps that OneCX platform takes when dealing with content loading with Webcomponent expose method: Load exposed content via Module Federation into memory. Create an HTML element on a page to which exposed content should be bound. In the Microfrontend content loading, it was mentioned that when exposing Microfrontend content, files specified per content should take care of all setup needed to display it. With Webcomponent method, those files need to contain source code, which will register the Custom Element in the Custom Elements Registry. Without getting into the details of Web Components, a file used for content loading needs to use Web Components to assign some component to the HTML element that OneCX platform will render. This way, when OneCX platform creates this HTML element on a page, the Custom Elements Registry will use the assigned component and display it on a page. To correctly use Webcomponent expose method, 2 requirements need to be fullfield: Database is correctly configured for module or Remote Component technology set to WebComponent tag name set to agreed HTML element name Microfrontend is adapted to expose Web Components compliant content desired component needs to be registered as Custom Element in the Custom Elements Registry Angular issues are covered (use the @onecx/angular-webcomponents library to cover them by default) multiple routers synchronization ngZone sharing platform sharing Database configuration is easy to set up using the Application Store Application. To ensure Microfrontend compliance with Web Components for Angular modules and Remote Components, it is recommended to use the @onecx/angular-webcomponents library. OneCX platform offers different ways of exposing Microfrontend’s content. One of them is Webcomponent method. When exposing content with Webcomponent method, it is required to ensure the correct setup. For exposing Angular content, there are functionalities provided via the @onecx/angular-webcomponents library. For a detailed guide on how to expose Microfrontend’s content via Webcomponent method, please refer here. Using @onecx/angular-webcomponents library, according to the guide, is the recommended way of exposing Angular content. The set of functionalities provided via the library is taking care of all requirements related to the Web Components adaptation. Apart from automatic registration to the Custom Elements Registry, they ensure that the following issues are covered: Every module and Remote Component is going to have its own router. Routers (Shell’s router, displayed module’s router, and router of each displayed Remote Component) need to be synchronized so each can react to the router events. A Single Angular version can only create one platform to operate on, which means that for every content loaded within a page, the same platform has to be used for a specific version. ngZone of Shell UI has to be shared with all modules and Remote Components to allow Web Components to function correctly. In-depth explanations for those issues can be found in the Module Federation multi-framework and version micro frontends document. As stated in Microfrontend content loading documentation, every method of Microfrontend’s content exposal has an impact on the OneCX platform behavior for both module and Remote Component loading. The adaptations made by OneCX to work with Web Components were briefly mentioned in the Web Components preview, however depending on the content type, the behavior varies. The Shell UI App is responsible for displaying Microfrontend’s module when router navigation is matched for a desired Microfrontend. With Webcomponent method, Shell UI will adapt the loadChildren method to: load desired remote module using @angular-architects/module-federation (no change). use WebComponentLoaderModule as the module to be lazy-loaded (instead of the Microfrontend’s module). The loadChildren method bound to a Route is an asynchronous method that in the end should return a module to be displayed when activating a certain Route. With Webcomponent method, the desired Microfrontend’s module is still being loaded using @angular-architects/module-federation. During that loading, it should register a component in the Custom Elements Registry, as mentioned in the previous section. For OneCX platform, it means that it no longer should load the Microfrontend’s module directly but ensure that the HTML code has the correct Custom Element in order to display the module. WebComponentLoaderModule is a simple Angular module with a Router set up to always display WebComponentLoaderComponent. This component is responsible for rendering the HTML element required to display the module with Web Components Custom Elements. Whenever Shell UI’s router detects a change of the Microfrontend (another path is matched than the current one), it calls loadChildren method to load the desired module and returns WebComponentLoaderModule. The module then creates and initializes WebComponentLoaderComponent, which, after initializations, creates the HTML element. Then Web Components using Custom Elements technology bounds the Microfrontend’s module to the created element. For a detailed guide on how to expose Microfrontend’s module via Webcomponent method, please refer here. Slot Component is responsible for displaying Microfrontend’s Remote Components during Slot Component initialization. With the Webcomponent method, the Slot Component will adapt the steps to: load desired remote content using @angular-architects/module-federation (no change). create HTML element directly inside a container (instead of creating Microfrontend’s Remote Component instance). The Slot Component content is based on Angular ViewContainerRef to dynamically create content inside the Slot Component. With Webcomponent method, the desired Microfrontend’s Remote Component is still being loaded using @angular-architects/module-federation. During that loading, it should register a component in the Custom Elements Registry, as mentioned in the previous section. For OneCX platform, it means that it no longer should create the Microfrontend’s component directly but ensure that the HTML code has the correct element in order to display the component. The difference with the Webcomponent method is that, from the OneCX platform’s perspective, no component needs to be created. Instead, a \"host\" element must be created to allow Web Components' Custom Elements to display desired content. For a detailed guide on how to expose Microfrontend’s Remote Components via Webcomponent method, please refer here. Using @onecx/angular-webcomponents to expose modules and Remote Components via Microfrontends is the recommended way within the OneCX platform. There are guides available that showcase how to transform already-created Microfrontend’s content to use Webcomponent method. In this section, all the specific functions available within the angular-webcomponents library are explained. Use bootstrapModule function for Angular module bootstrapping.

It is required to utilize Webpack technology to expose Microfrontend’s content via a remote entry file, so the Shell and other Microfrontends (e.g. via Slot Components) are able to load and use it. Webpack is a powerful module bundler for JavaScript, which takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. Since Webpack version five, Module Federation technology, integrated with Webpack, is used to achieve these goals. For Angular based Microfrontends, consider using @angular-architects/module-federation package. This package is used internally by OneCX to load remote modules and is recommended for Angular based applications. Each Microfrontend integrated with OneCX needs to have a configuration file for Webpack (usually called webpack.config.js), utilizing Module Federation to expose remote modules. For both module and Remote Components, a remote module needs to be exposed. Webpack configuration is going to contain important configuration describing the Microfrontend. This configuration is used by Webpack to create and expose a remote entry file containing the whole code required to load remote modules in other Applications using Module Federation. Below, a Webpack configuration example of an Angular based Microfrontend is presented. const { ModifyEntryPlugin } = require('@angular-architects/module-federation/src/utils/modify-entry-plugin') const { share, withModuleFederationPlugin } = require('@angular-architects/module-federation/webpack') const config = withModuleFederationPlugin({ name: 'example-ui', filename: 'remoteEntry.js', exposes: { './ExampleModule': './src/main.ts', './ExampleComponent': './src/remotes/example/example.component.main.ts' }, shared: share({ '@angular/core': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@angular/forms': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@angular/common': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: { skip: ['@angular/common/http/testing'] } }, '@angular/common/http': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@angular/platform-browser': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@angular/router': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@ngx-translate/core': { requiredVersion: 'auto' }, primeng: { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, rxjs: { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@onecx/accelerator': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@onecx/angular-accelerator': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@onecx/angular-auth': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@onecx/angular-integration-interface': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@onecx/angular-remote-components': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@onecx/angular-testing': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@onecx/angular-webcomponents': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@onecx/integration-interface': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@onecx/keycloak-auth': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@onecx/ngrx-accelerator': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@onecx/portal-integration-angular': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@onecx/portal-layout-styles': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true } }), sharedMappings: [] }) module.exports = config const plugins = config.plugins.filter((plugin) => !(plugin instanceof ModifyEntryPlugin)) module.exports = { ...config, plugins, output: { uniqueName: 'example-ui', publicPath: 'auto' }, experiments: { ...config.experiments, topLevelAwait: true }, optimization: { runtimeChunk: false, splitChunks: false } } The most important elements of Webpack configurations are: Exposed content Each Microfrontend can expose multiple modules and Remote Components. Every separate module and Remote Component needs to be defined as a separate, unique entry representing a remote module. Each entry is a Key-Value Pair: Key Name of the exposed module. Value File to be used for module bootstrap. In the Angular example, there are two remote modules defined: ExampleModule - Microfrontend’s remote module pointing to Microfrontend’s main.ts file. ExampleComponent - Remote Component’s remote module pointing to component’s main.ts file. Module Federation considers any exposed content as a remote module. In the OneCX context, Microfrontends expose two types of content, being modules and Remote Components. Shared resources Each Microfrontend can define packages that can be shared with others. Every Microfrontend can specify what packages and with what versions are allowed to be shared. In the OneCX context, it is important to ensure the correct package sharing configuration dependent on the used packages used functionalities within the Microfrontend’s exposed content. In the Angular example, there are multiple packages shared. All of them are related to OneCX. For the detailed explanation on package sharing with OneCX, please refer here. For even more information on how package sharing works, please refer here. Remote name The unique name of the Microfrontend. Remote entry file name The name of the remote entry file (usually remoteEntry.js). Content bootstrapping - based on the content type and expose method bootstrap mechanism needs to be adjusted.

The Permission Management application is in charge of managing permissions. For Angular applications User Service is available for permission checking. OneCX compatible application: can use the User Service to check permissions. In OneCX, there are 3 key concepts: permission, role and user. Each application can define many permissions that allow or deny an action on a specific resource (e.g., USER#DELETE) and then can validate if the permissions is met. Every user registered has set of roles assigned to them (e.g., admin) where each role is assigned with different permissions. With combination of those 3 concepts, application can be displayed differently based on the current user permissions. To set up permissions for the application, OneCX core applications should be used to add or modify existing permissions and assignments for roles.

Depending on the requirements different methods and properties should be used To check if the currently logged in user has specific permission(s), use the hasPermission method of User Service. example.ts const userService = inject(UserService) // Check for single permission userService.hasPermission('USER#DELETE') // Check for multiple permissions userService.hasPermission(['USER#EDIT', 'USER#EXPORT']) To get a list of all permissions for the current user in the context of the application, use the getPermissions method of User Service. example.ts const userService = inject(UserService) // Get all application permissions userService.getPermissions().pipe(( // Pipe the permission list ))","title":"OneCX Permissions","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"permissions","url":"/documentation/current/angular/cookbook/permissions.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"overview","id":1},{"text":"Permissions Overview","hash":"permissions-overview","id":2},{"text":"Permission Setup","hash":"permission-setup","id":3},{"text":"Permission Validation","hash":"permission-validation","id":4},{"text":"Check For Permission","hash":"check-for-permissions","id":5},{"text":"Get All Application Permissions","hash":"get-all-application-permissions","id":6}]},"35":{"id":35,"text":"In an OneCX application theming is handled by the OneCX shell in collaboration with the OneCX Theme Management application. OneCX compatible application: should use theme variables to theme its content. In OneCX each workspace can use different theme for its pages. Each theme defines a set of the same CSS variables that are available on each pages with different values. The availability of those CSS variables is handled by the OneCX shell based on the accessed workspace. It means that OneCX compatible application does not have to do anything to apply the theme. The only responsibility is to use theme variables. Theme variables are CSS variables available on the page for any application. Below, is a list of all theme variables available on the page: Basic Variables CSS variable Description --primary-color Primary color of non-text content. --secondary-color Secondary color of non-text content. --content-bg-color Default background color of non-text content. --hover-bg-color Default background color on hover of non-text content. Text-related Variables CSS variable Description --font-family Default font family for text content. --font-size Default font size for text content. --text-color Primary font text color. --text-secondary-color Secondary font text color for elements in lower design hierarchy, usually less prominent. Button-related Variables CSS variable Description --button-hover-bg Background color of a button in hover state. --button-active-bg Background color of a button in active state. --danger-button-bg Background color of a button with danger severity. Message-related Variables CSS variable Description --info-message-bg Background color of a message with info severity. --success-message-bg Background color of a message with success severity. --warning-message-bg Background color of a message with warning severity. --error-message-bg Background color of a message with error severity. Misc Variables CSS variable Description --divider-color Color of divider HTML elements, such as <hr> or component borders. --body-bg-color Background color of the document’s body, used for the content pane’s background color. --overlay-content-bg-color Background color of the overlays, Topbar Variables CSS variable Description --topbar-bg-color Background color of the topbar. --topbar-left-bg-color Background color of the topbar’s left side. --topbar-text-color Color of the text in the topbar. --topbar-item-text-color Color of the text of the items located in the topbar. --topbar-item-text-hover-bg-color Background color for the items located in the topbar on hover state. --topbar-menu-button-bg-color Background color of the vertical menu hiding toggle. --logo-color Color of the topbar’s logo. Sidebar Variables CSS variable Description --menu-bg-color Background color of the sidebar (left side of the shell). --menu-text-color Text color of the menu, located in the sidebar (left side of the shell). --menu-item-text-color Text color of the menu item, located in the sidebar (left side of the shell). --menu-item-bg-color Background color of the menu item, located in the sidebar (left side of the shell). --menu-item-hover-bg-color Background color of the menu item in hover state, located in the sidebar (left side of the shell). --menu-active-item-text-color Text color of the menu item in active state, located in the sidebar (left side of the shell). --menu-active-item-bg-color Background color of the menu item in active state, located in the sidebar (left side of the shell). When creating styles for UI components it’s important to consider whether a style should be theme-aware.

Write Unit Tests and Component Tests. Prefer Unit Tests over Component Tests. Manually test with shell and in the standalone mode. Tests should run in the build pipeline. The following guideline are applying for asynchronous code and the work with Observables: Do not assign the value of an Observable to members of a component or other class (function calls are OK). If storing of the value is needed, consider a BehaviorSubject. Consider the use of the Async pipe when displaying asynchronous values. Always think about unsubscribing. Unsubscribing is needed when the Observable is not created inside the component and emits an infinite number of values. HTTP Call: no unsubscribing needed (created externally but emits only one value). BehaviorSubject inside the component: no unsubscribing needed (emits an infinite number of values but created inside the component) BehaviorSubject in a service: unsubscribing needed (created externally and emits an infinite number of values) The following guideline are applying for translations: Consider the translate pipe If needed, the translations should be done locally and not in ngOnInit(). Do not use TranslateService.instant. A translation key is only used in one place. Create new one with the same value if required. Shared components in a library should have default translations in the translation files of the library. Only if needed, create an Input in the component to customize the displayed string. Every page has its own subsection in the translation file that is called like the component. The structure in the subsection follows the structure of the page. Translations of shared components are stored in a subsection with the name of the component. No wrapper “DEFAULTS” is needed in the translation files in a library. The following guidelines are applying for components: The HTML should be leading not the TS. Do not use inheritance. Consider a transclude instead. Components should have only one clear responsibility. Components are either technical or business driven, not both. Smart component, dumb component-principle Committed code must have a certain quality. The following guidelines must be considered: Do not commit commented out code. Comments should only be used to: Document the Why of the code and not the What. Create documentation for the autocompletion mechanism. Do not commit debug outputs. console.log() message should be used to inform about error or problem and to give some information of the application state e.g., \"Configuration loaded with values xyz\" Remove unused imports Format the code Run npm run format If you need to format a specific file, you can use: nx format:write –files filepath The following examples shows a potential folder structure, that might be extended based on the need.

NgRx is a framework for building reactive applications in Angular. OneCx uses NgRx to manage the state of an applet. The communication with the store is done by smart components, usually by the page components. An action is only dispatched at one place. Actions are never dispatched conditionally. For every component that is getting data from the store there is an interface for the viewmodel that is called like the component class but with postfix \"ViewModel\". For every component that is getting data from the store there is a selector for the viewmodel that is called like the viewmodel interface but with the prefix \"select\". Every component that is getting data from the store selects only the viewmodel via the viewmodel selector. The observable that is storing the result is called viewModel$. Every HTML file of a component that is getting data from the store has an outer ng-container tag that is using the ngrxLet directive e.g. *ngrxLet=\"viewModel$ as vm\". The store never stores data that can be computed from other data in the store. This is done in selectors. Selectors are only accessing the data on top-level of the part of the store that is past to it. Every feature module has its own feature store. The store is the model of the applet and is modeled like that. Data that is relevant for all pages in the feature are stored on top-level. Data that is only relevant for one page is stored in a subsection of the store which is called like the page. All HTTP calls are done in effects. Routing or changing the URL parameters via the angular router is done in effects. Selectors, reducers and effects are tested. For reducers there is at least a test for the initial state and for one state that is not the initial state. Effects are tested via marble testing. Selector tests are testing the projector function of the selectors. See example for NgRx project The following examples shows a potential folder structure, that might be extended based on the need.

The viewmodel can be passed via an input which is called 'vm'. The viewmodel is read from the store via a viewmodel selector in the effects or is build with data from the action which is triggering the opening of the dialog. The dialogs can also dispatch actions but only if they are not used to react on the closing of the dialog. Reacting to the closing is always done via the Observable returned by openDialog(…​) The structure and inner workings of a dialog that is used in many pages is similar to the structure of a page.

Please refer to this Troubleshooting Guide shell related section on how to use DevTools to inspect shared packages. Impact: Router out of sync, many potential issues For step-by-step instructions on migrating a vanilla Angular App to a OneCX-compatible microfrontend using @onecx/angular-webcomponents among other packages, refer to the Migration Steps in Vanilla to OneCX Migration Guide. Impact: Applications exposed with different technologies might not be compatible with the Shell Ensure your App exposes remoteEntry.js and is configured for module federation. Impact: Translations missing Confirm assets (e.g., i18n) from libraries are exposed and available in your build output. Include the assets of the libraries they use in the angular.json or project.json file.

Please refer to the OneCX General Routing Guide for using relative paths and other information on routing in OneCX. Impact: Translation issues Ensure your webpack configuration includes the correct importMeta configuration. For the correct configuration, please refer to the OneCX Multi-language Translations Guide and other information on multi-language in OneCX.

The @ngx-translate/core package has to be installed in the project. npm i @ngx-translate/core Make sure to add a ^ sign in the package.json file of the project for @ngx-translate/core library. The @ngx-translate/core package has to be added as a shared package in webpack configuration. const config = withModuleFederationPlugin({ ... shared: share({ ... '@ngx-translate/core': { requiredVersion: 'auto' }, ... }), }); This ensures the package is shared between the app and OneCX. Create translation files (e.g., en.json, de.json) in a directory such as assets/i18n/. These files will contain key-value pairs for each language. en.json { \"HELLO\": \"Hello\", \"WELCOME\": \"Welcome\" } In your remote module file, import the following: remote.module.ts import { addInitializeModuleGuard, AppStateService } from '@onecx/angular-integration-interface'; import { createTranslateLoader, provideTranslationPathFromMeta } from '@onecx/angular-utils'; Wrap your routes with addInitializeModuleGuard to ensure translations are loaded correctly: remote.module.ts imports: [ ... RouterModule.forRoot(addInitializeModuleGuard(routes)), ... ] Add TranslateModule.forRoot() to your module’s imports array (or commonImports if shared): remote.module.ts imports: [ ... TranslateModule.forRoot({ isolate: false, loader: { provide: TranslateLoader, useFactory: createTranslateLoader, deps: [HttpClient] } }), ... ] Optionally, if you intend to support multiple locales at the same time in case of missing translations for the current locale, you can utilize the MultiLanguageMissingTranslationHandler available via @onecx/angular-utils: remote.module.ts import { MultiLanguageMissingTranslationHandler } from '@onecx/angular-utils' imports: [ ... TranslateModule.forRoot({ isolate: false, loader: { provide: TranslateLoader, useFactory: createTranslateLoader, deps: [HttpClient] }, missingTranslationHandler: { provide: MissingTranslationHandler, useClass: MultiLanguageMissingTranslationHandler } }), ... ] Use provideTranslationPathFromMeta(import.meta.url, …​) to specify the location of your translation files: remote.module.ts providers: [ ... provideTranslationPathFromMeta(import.meta.url, 'assets/i18n/'), ... ] Replace 'assets/i18n/' with the actual path to your translation files if different. If the error \"Cannot construct translation path from local file path. Please check whether the webpack configuration for importMeta is correct: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#moduleparserjavascriptimportmeta\" appears, it means either the provider is used in the application and import.meta.url incorrectly resolves to a local file:// path. or the application does not use provideTranslationPathFromMeta, but is likely using a newer Angular version than the shell or preloader.

It is important to follow these guidelines to ensure that routing is handled correctly within the OneCX ecosystem. Before implementing routing in your OneCX application, ensure your application is OneCX compatible. In OneCX, each application can be accessed via different base paths depending on the workspace configuration. Below are some examples of how the same application might be accessed: https://shell_deployment_path/my-workspace/my-application https://shell_deployment_path/employees-workspace/client-management/base When an application is accessed via OneCX shell, the base path can vary, but every time the common parts are: https://shell_deployment_path/ - the deployment path of the OneCX shell my-workspace or employees-workspace - the workspace identifier my-application or client-management/base - the application path What is important to note is that the workspace identifier and application path are not fixed and can be different depending on the workspace that the app is accessed from and the workspace configuration. OneCX shell handles the routing to the correct application based on the workspace configuration. It handles that on every navigation that changes the active workspace or application. As an example, if any application navigates to https://shell_deployment_path/employees-workspace/client-management/client/123, the OneCX shell will ensure that the employees-workspace is activated and the client-management application is loaded with the correct context. The url parts that OneCX shell handles are: https://shell_deployment_path/ - the deployment path of the OneCX shell employees-workspace - the workspace used to determine which workspace data to load client-management - the application path to determine which application to load The rest of the URL path should be handled by the application itself. In this case, the client/123 part should be handled by the client-management application. Application’s router will not be aware of the used parts of the URL that OneCX shell handles. Therefore, it is required to have appropriate routing mechanisms in order to ensure that the application can handle routing correctly regardless of the workspace configuration. When routing inside the application, it is important to use relative paths instead of absolute paths. This ensures that the application can handle routing correctly regardless of the workspace configuration. Application is currently at https://shell_deployment_path/employees-workspace/client-management and needs to navigate to a client with ID 123, it should use a relative path. this.router.navigate(['client', 123]); Application is currently at https://shell_deployment_path/employees-workspace/client-management/client/123 and needs to navigate back to the client list, it should use a relative path. this.router.navigate(['../'], { relativeTo: this.route }); Sometimes, it might be necessary to use absolute paths for routing. In such cases, it is crucial to construct the absolute path dynamically based on the current workspace configuration. This can be achieved by using the AppStateService to get the currentMfe$, which contains the current workspace and application information. Application is currently at https://shell_deployment_path/employees-workspace/client-management and needs to navigate to a client with ID 123 using an absolute path. It should construct the absolute path dynamically. import { firstValueFrom } from 'rxjs'; ... appStateService: AppStateService; // Injected via constructor async routeOnClick() { const mfeInfo = await firstValueFrom(this.appStateService.currentMfe$); this.router.navigateByUrl(`/${mfeInfo.baseUrl}/client/123`); } If you are using ngrx, you can use the AppStateService directly in your effects to construct the absolute path dynamically. If it is necessary to route between different applications or to specific endpoints, it is recommended to use the WorkspaceService. The WorkspaceService provides methods to: Dynamically construct URLs for applications and endpoints based on the current workspace. Validate whether a route or endpoint exists before navigating. Resolve endpoint aliases and inject parameters into endpoint paths. This approach ensures that applications remain decoupled from static configurations and are fully integrated into the OneCX workspace model.","title":"OneCX Routing","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"index","url":"/documentation/current/angular/cookbook/routing/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"overview","id":1},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"prerequisites","id":2},{"text":"Reasons for restrictions","hash":"reasons-for-restrictions","id":3},{"text":"Why Routing Restrictions?","hash":"why-routing-restrictions","id":4},{"text":"OneCX Shell Routing","hash":"onecx-shell-routing","id":5},{"text":"General Routing Guidelines","hash":"general-routing-guidelines","id":6},{"text":"Routing Inside the Application","hash":"routing-inside-application","id":7},{"text":"Examples","hash":"routing-inside-application-examples","id":8},{"text":"Navigate to details page","hash":"navigate-to-details-page","id":9},{"text":"Navigate back","hash":"navigate-back","id":10},{"text":"Routing Using Absolute Paths","hash":"routing-using-absolute-paths","id":11},{"text":"Examples","hash":"routing-using-absolute-paths-examples","id":12},{"text":"Navigate to details page using absolute path","hash":"navigate-to-details-page-absolute","id":13},{"text":"Routing Between Applications","hash":"routing-between-applications","id":14}]},"47":{"id":47,"text":"The goal of this guide is to provide step by step instructions on how to enable standalone mode for an existing OneCX application and allowing it to run without a shell. This guide assumes that an Angular project is already set up and migrated to be compatible with OneCX. Note that this guide does not cover general Angular project setup or the steps to migrate to OneCX. The goal of this cookbook is to refactor an existing OneCX compatible app so that it can not only run inside the OneCX platform but also as a standalone application. All steps have been tested in an app generated with Angular CLI and migrated to be compatible with OneCX but should also work in other OneCX compatible Angular apps (e.g. apps generated with NX). To achieve the goal of running an application in standalone, a second set of entrypoint files has to be created. Similarly to the applications remote module in remote scenarios, the standalone entrypoint files will be used to add necessary imports and providers, and route requests to the correct feature modules. A detailed overview of which files have to be created can be found in later sections of this document. In order to run a OneCX app in standalone, it’s necessary to mock/provide some of the functionality that would usually be provided by the OneCX platform. To make this easy, @onecx/standalone-shell provides all the necessary code wrapped in a importable Angular module. Before using the module, the necessary dependency has to be added to the app. The dependency has to be installed using the version that is also used for other @onecx libraries in the project. The minimum required version of @onecx/standalone-shell is 5.31.0. npm i @onecx/standalone-shell To avoid confusion, the projects ./src/main.ts and ./src/bootstrap.ts files should be renamed to remote-main.ts and remote-bootstrap.ts. Make sure to also adjust references to ./src/main.ts and ./src/bootstrap.ts (e.g. in tsconfig.app.json and webpack.config.js). If remote-main.ts and remote-bootstrap.ts already exist in the project, no further action is required. When running an app in standalone, ./src/app/app.module.ts, ./src/app/app.component.html and ./src/app/app.component.ts are treated as the application entrypoints. To add standalone capabilities to the application, the StandaloneShellModule provided by @onecx/standalone-shell has to be added to the imports array of ./src/app/app.module.ts. Make sure to add the import as the last entry of the imports array. Afterwards the entire application has to be wrapped in a standalone-shell-viewport component provided as part of the imported StandaloneShellModule. To achieve this goal the contents of ./src/app/app.component.html have to be replaced with the following code: <ocx-standalone-shell-viewport></ocx-standalone-shell-viewport> Afterwards it should be ensured that the applications remote entrypoint (e.g. ./src/app/app-entrypoint.component.ts) and the applications standalone entrypoint (e.g. ./src/app/app.component.ts) have different selector names. The selector name can be found inside the @Component annotation that is placed before the component class in the components TypeScript file. Since ./src/app/app.module.ts is not loaded in remote scenarios and the projects remote module is skipped in standalone mode it’s crucial that all critical imports and providers are present in both modules. To achieve this goal it’s recommended to create two exported variables in the remote module file before the actual module class. The variable commonImports should contain an array of imports that need to be present in both modules. Similarly the variable commonProviders should contain an array of providers that need to be present in both modules. After creating those variables they should be added to the imports and providers array in both modules. By doing this, the applications remote module is treated as the single source of truth, which helps with preventing import and provider errors. // Example providers and imports import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser' import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations' import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common' import { provideHttpClient, withInterceptorsFromDi } from '@angular/common/http' export const commonProviders = [ provideHttpClient(withInterceptorsFromDi()), ... ] export const commonImports = [ BrowserModule, BrowserAnimationsModule, CommonModule, ... ] export class RemoteModule implements DoBootstrap { ... } To correctly render the standalone entrypoint, it has to be referenced in index.html. Therefore the element tag placed inside the body of ./src/index.html must match the selector name of the applications standalone entrypoint (e.g. ./src/app/app.component.ts), which can be obtained as mentioned above. To correctly bootstrap and render the standalone version of an application, it’s necessary to create separate main and bootstrap files alongside the already existing files used for microfrontend bootstrapping (e.g. ./src/remote-main.ts and ./src/remote-bootstrap.ts). The newly created bootstrap file must contain the following code: import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic' import { AppModule } from './app/app.module' platformBrowserDynamic() .bootstrapModule(AppModule) .catch((err) => console.error(err)) The newly created main file should import the bootstrap files and handle potential errors: import('./bootstrap').catch((err) => console.error(err)) After creating the files, the newly created main files must be referenced in the files array in tsconfig.app.json so that it’s included in the applications bundle. Additionally it should be verified that the build.options.main property in the applications configuration file (e.g. angular.json or project.json) points to the newly created main file. To ensure correct translation loading in an application using @ngx-translate a few more modifications have to be applied to ./src/app/app.module.ts. The package @ngx-translate/core has to be installed in the project. The routes passed to RouterModule.forRoot() must be wrapped with addInitializeModuleGuard from @onecx/angular-integration-interface. This ensures correct translation loading for each route. Note that the route configuration might be placed in a separate routing module (e.g. ./src/app/app-routing.module.ts) or in the commonImports you created in your applications remote module. imports: [ ... RouterModule.forRoot(addInitializeModuleGuard(routes)), ... ], TranslateModule.forRoot() has to be configured in the app modules imports array or the commonImports array that is being shared between app.module.ts and the application’s remote module. createTranslateLoader has to be imported from @onecx/angular-utils and ensures that the correct translation files is loaded on app load. If @onecx/angular-utils is not yet installed in the project, it has to be installed first. Note that the property isolate should not be necessary in a pure standalone setup and is only required when adding the TranslateModule configuration to a commonImports array. imports: [ ... TranslateModule.forRoot({ isolate: false, loader: { provide: TranslateLoader, useFactory: createTranslateLoader, deps: [HttpClient] } }), ... ], The path to the applications translations is provided automatically by the previously imported StandaloneShellModule. If any errors occur during translation loading, the network tab of the browsers developer tools can be used to verify that the application’s translation files are placed in the correct location. Disclaimer: If any of the applications feature modules use ngx-translate features, such as the translate pipe, TranslateModule might have to be added to the feature modules imports array. After following the above mentioned steps the app should be accessible on its configured URL (e.g. http://localhost:4200).","title":"Enable OneCX app to run in standalone","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"index","url":"/documentation/current/angular/cookbook/migrations/enable-standalone/index.html","titles":[{"text":"General","hash":"general","id":1},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"prerequisites","id":2},{"text":"Steps","hash":"steps","id":3},{"text":"Install @onecx/standalone-shell","hash":"install-dependecies","id":4},{"text":"Rename existing entrypoint files","hash":"rename-entrypoint-files","id":5},{"text":"Import StandaloneShellModule and modify app.component.html + app.component.ts","hash":"add-standalone-module","id":6},{"text":"Add necessary imports and providers to app.module.ts","hash":"align-imports-and-providers-with-remote","id":7},{"text":"Use AppComponent selector in index.html","hash":"update-index-html","id":8},{"text":"Create separate main.ts and bootstrap.ts for standalone","hash":"create-standalone-entrypoints","id":9},{"text":"Optional: Set up @ngx-translate translation loading","hash":"configure-translation-loading","id":10},{"text":"Verify that the app is running in standalone","hash":"verify-standalone-mode","id":11}]},"48":{"id":48,"text":"The goal of this guide is to provide step by step instructions on how to migrate a vanilla Angular app to a OneCX compatible microfrontend application. This guide assumes that an Angular project is already set up and that a OneCX platform instance is up and running. At the time of writing, some required dependencies are only compatible with Angular version 18. Therefore the application must be updated to Angular 18 before migrating. Additionally, the Angular application should be based on feature modules, which are lazy loaded before routing or route directly to standalone components. Note that this guide does not cover general Angular project setup or the steps to configure OneCX. The goal of this migration is to transform a \"vanilla\" Angular app into a OneCX compatible app that exposes a microfrontend which can be loaded and displayed by the OneCX platform. To achieve this goal, a few migration steps have to be completed. All steps have been tested in fresh Angular apps generated with the Angular CLI and the NX CLI (using Webpack as a bundler). Some steps only apply to either Angular CLI or NX based applications and are marked accordingly. Before starting the migration, the correct functionality of the application in its \"pre-migration\" state should be verified by running existing tests, building the app and running it in a browser. This ensures that the app functions as expected before the migration, helping to prevent unexpected errors in later stages of the process. In order to convert an app into a OneCX compatible microfrontend it’s necessary to first install some dependencies which allow wrapping the app inside a OneCX compatible webcomponent and exposing it as a remote entrypoint. Dependencies npm i @angular/elements@18 @angular-architects/module-federation @onecx/angular-integration-interface @onecx/angular-utils @onecx/angular-webcomponents @webcomponents/webcomponentsjs Dev-Dependencies (Only Angular CLI) npm i -D webpack webpack-merge ngx-build-plus@18 For nx based applications the above mentioned dev dependencies are not needed as these apps already ship with a configurable builder. To correctly bundle an app for use in a microfrontend context, the default Angular bundler must be replaced with ngx-build-plus, and a few additional configuration options need to be specified. YOUR_APP_NAME should be replaced with the name of the actual application, which can be obtained from angular.json. TODO comments should be taken care of and afterwards removed from the file. angular.json ... \"architect\": { \"build\": { \"builder\": \"ngx-build-plus:browser\", \"options\": { ... // TODO: property \"browser\" should be removed in favor of \"main\" if it exists \"main\": \"src/main.ts\", \"scripts\": [\"node_modules/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-bundle.js\"], \"extraWebpackConfig\": \"webpack.config.js\", // TODO: Replace \"./YOUR_ASSETS_FOLDER\" with the path to your projects asset folder. \"assets\": [ { \"glob\": \"**/*\", \"input\": \"./YOUR_ASSETS_FOLDER\", \"output\": \"assets\" }, ... ] }, ... \"configurations\": { \"production\": { ... \"extraWebpackConfig\": \"webpack.prod.config.js\" }, ... } }, \"serve\": { \"builder\": \"ngx-build-plus:dev-server\", \"options\": { ... \"buildTarget\": \"YOUR_APP_NAME:build\", \"port\": 4200, \"publicHost\": \"http://localhost:4200\", \"extraWebpackConfig\": \"webpack.config.js\" }, \"configurations\": { ... \"production\": { ... \"extraWebpackConfig\": \"webpack.prod.config.js\" }, }, ... }, \"extract-i18n\": { \"builder\": \"ngx-build-plus:extract-i18n\", \"options\": { \"buildTarget\": \"YOUR_APP_NAME:build\", \"extraWebpackConfig\": \"webpack.config.js\" } }, ... } To correctly bundle an app for use in a microfrontend context, the default bundler used for NX Angular projects must be replaced with a specific Webpack bundler, and a few additional configuration options need to be specified. project.json ... \"targets\": { \"build\": { \"executor\": \"@nx/angular:webpack-browser\", \"options\": { ... \"scripts\": [\"node_modules/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-bundle.js\"], \"customWebpackConfig\": { \"path\": \"webpack.config.js\" }, // TODO: Replace \"./YOUR_ASSETS_FOLDER\" with the path to your projects asset folder. \"assets\": [ { \"glob\": \"**/*\", \"input\": \"./YOUR_ASSETS_FOLDER\", \"output\": \"assets\" }, ... ] }, ... \"configurations\": { \"production\": { ... \"customWebpackConfig\": { \"path\": \"webpack.prod.config.js\" } }, ... } }, \"serve\": { \"builder\": \"@nx/angular:dev-server\", ... }, ... } To enable an app to run both as a standalone application and as a microfrontend, it’s necessary to provide separate entry points for remote and standalone consumption. This guide will focus on the creation of the remote/microfrontend entrypoints and doesn’t require any changes to an Angular apps default entrypoints (app.module.ts, app.component.ts etc.). For instructions on how to prepare a migrated OneCX application and its entrypoints for standalone consumption see the Standalone Mode section of this document. This component will serve as the root entrypoint of the application, when served as a microfrontend. To provide a router outlet at the root of the exposed microfrontend the components HTML must contain the default Angular router-outlet. <router-outlet></router-outlet> Alongside the created HTML file the following TypeScript file should be created. import { Component } from '@angular/core' @Component({ selector: 'app-root', templateUrl: './app-entrypoint.component.html' }) export class AppEntrypointComponent {} To declare the entrypoint component and provide a root module for the microfrontend (equivalent to app.module), a separate module has to be created. It serves as sort of a replacement for the normal app.module.ts file which will be treated as the application root in the microfrontend context and enables specific module configuration for the different use-cases. Additionally it exposes the previously mentioned entrypoint component as a web component. Apart from the microfrontend specific code, the module should also include all essential imports, providers etc. that would normally be included in the app.module.ts file. To ensure a correct loading of the application microfrontend and a connection between the app’s router and the OneCX router, the module must at least include the following code (ocx-test-component should be replaced with whatever name makes sense for the application that is being migrated): import { APP_INITIALIZER, DoBootstrap, Injector, NgModule } from '@angular/core' import { RouterModule, Routes, Router } from '@angular/router' import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser' import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations' import { createAppEntrypoint, initializeRouter, startsWith } from '@onecx/angular-webcomponents' import { AppStateService } from '@onecx/angular-integration-interface' import { AppEntrypointComponent } from './app-entrypoint.component' // TODO: Replace with application routes const routes: Routes = [ { matcher: startsWith(''), loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then((m) => m.FeatureModule) }, { matcher: startsWith('additional'), loadChildren: () => import('./feature2/feature2.module').then((m) => m.FeatureModule) } ] @NgModule({ declarations: [AppEntrypointComponent], imports: [ BrowserModule, BrowserAnimationsModule, RouterModule.forRoot(routes), ], providers: [ { provide: APP_INITIALIZER, useFactory: initializeRouter, multi: true, deps: [Router, AppStateService] } ] }) export class RemoteModule implements DoBootstrap { constructor(private readonly injector: Injector) {} ngDoBootstrap(): void { createAppEntrypoint(AppEntrypointComponent, 'ocx-test-component', this.injector) } } In this example the remote.module.ts file provides a remote entrypoint component, called ocx-test-component, connects the remote app’s router to the OneCX router and defines two routes that each route to a different feature module. Depending on the application this file will vary heavily and contain different providers, imports etc.. To ensure correct routing using the Angular router, instead of specifying a path for each route, a matcher should be specified using the startsWith function from the @onecx/angular-webcomponents package. To ensure correct translation loading in an application using @ngx-translate a few modifications have to be applied to the remote module mentioned above. The package @ngx-translate/core has to be installed in the project. After installing the package, it has to be added to the shared configuration in the webpack.config.js file. This ensures that the package is shared between the app and OneCX. const config = withModuleFederationPlugin({ ... shared: share({ ... '@ngx-translate/core': { requiredVersion: 'auto' }, ... }), }) After the initial configuration, translation files can be created and translations can be used in the app. After creating the translation files, a few imports have to be added at the beginning of the remote module file. import { addInitializeModuleGuard, AppStateService } from '@onecx/angular-integration-interface'; import { createTranslateLoader, provideTranslationPathFromMeta } from '@onecx/angular-utils' The routes passed to RouterModule.forRoot() must be wrapped with addInitializeModuleGuard. This ensures correct translation loading for each route. imports: [ ... RouterModule.forRoot(addInitializeModuleGuard(routes)), ... ], TranslateModule.forRoot() has to be configured in the modules imports array or the commonImports array that is being shared between app.module.ts and the remote module. The factory function createTranslateLoader ensures that the correct translation files is loaded on app load. imports: [ ... TranslateModule.forRoot({ isolate: false, loader: { provide: TranslateLoader, useFactory: createTranslateLoader, deps: [HttpClient] } }), ... ], The path to the applications translations has to be provided using provideTranslationPathFromMeta(import.meta.url,…​). providers: [ ... provideTranslationPathFromMeta(import.meta.url, 'assets/i18n/'), ... ] If the error \"Cannot construct translation path from local file path. Please check whether the webpack configuration for importMeta is correct: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#moduleparserjavascriptimportmeta\" appears, it means either the provider is used in the application and import.meta.url incorrectly resolves to a local file:// path. or the application does not use provideTranslationPathFromMeta, but is likely using a newer Angular version than the shell or preloader. In this case, modules are loaded from the app’s context, which also leads to a local file:// prefix. To fix this, this line has to be added to module.exports in the webpack.config.js: webpack.config.ts module.exports = { ... module: { parser: { javascript: { importMeta: false } } }, } Disclaimer: If any of the applications feature modules use ngx-translate features, such as the translate pipe, TranslateModule might have to be added to the feature modules imports array. To correctly bootstrap and later expose the microfrontend application, a file called src/remote-bootstrap.ts has to be created with the following contents: import { bootstrapModule } from '@onecx/angular-webcomponents' import { RemoteModule } from './app/remote.module' // TODO: Replace this with a dynamic value (e.g. from environment.ts) const isProduction = false bootstrapModule(RemoteModule, 'microfrontend', isProduction) Additionally a file called src/remote-main.ts should be created. This file will call the newly created bootstrap script and handle any errors. If any additional code has to be executed after a successful bootstrapping of the application, it can be placed in a .then block after the import statement and before the catch statement. import('./remote-bootstrap').catch((err) => console.error(err)) To ensure that the newly created file remote-main.ts is part of the compiled bundle, its location has to be added to the files array in tsconfig.app.json. \"files\": [ ... \"src/app/remote-main.ts\" ], After creating all necessary entrypoint files and modifying the build configuration, all that’s left to do is to configure the application to expose all necessary entrypoint code in one consumable file called remoteEntry.js. This file will be used by the OneCX platform to obtain all information, necessary to render the microfrontend version of the application. In order to expose this file and ensure correct dependency sharing between the app and OneCX, a Webpack config file containing specific configuration properties has to be created. The file, webpack.config.js, which should be placed in the root folder of the application must contain the following configuration: This file is meant to be used as a minimal starting point. Depending on the application the contents of the file, especially the shared config, may need to be adapted. const { ModifyEntryPlugin } = require('@angular-architects/module-federation/src/utils/modify-entry-plugin') const { share, withModuleFederationPlugin } = require('@angular-architects/module-federation/webpack') const config = withModuleFederationPlugin({ name: 'YOUR_MFE_NAME', filename: 'remoteEntry.js', exposes: { './RemoteModule': 'src/remote-main.ts', }, shared: share({ '@angular/core': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@angular/common': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: { skip: ['@angular/common/http/testing'] } }, '@angular/common/http': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@angular/forms': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@angular/platform-browser': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@angular/router': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, rxjs: { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@onecx/angular-integration-interface': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@onecx/angular-utils': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, '@onecx/angular-webcomponents': { requiredVersion: 'auto', includeSecondaries: true }, }), }) config.devServer = { allowedHosts: 'all' } const plugins = config.plugins.filter((plugin) => !(plugin instanceof ModifyEntryPlugin)) module.exports = { ...config, plugins, output: { uniqueName: 'YOUR_MFE_NAME', publicPath: 'auto' }, experiments: { ...config.experiments, topLevelAwait: true }, optimization: { runtimeChunk: false, splitChunks: false } } To allow for a custom Webpack configuration in production environments it’s a good practice to additionally create a webpack.prod.js file that will extend the base config: module.exports = require('./webpack.config') If necessary, this file can be used to overwrite or extend the contents of the base config with production specific values. During the loading of an app, OneCX will try to load it’s environment file. To avoid any errors, a file called env.json should be accessible at http://localhost:4200/assets/env.json. This can be achieved by adding the respective file to the assets folder of the application. The file can be used to pass environment variables to OneCX. For now it can just contain an empty object ({}). After completing all steps listed above, the application should be ready to be used as a microfrontend in the OneCX platform. After starting the application with its start command (e.g. npm start), the applications entrypoint file (remoteEntry.js) should be accessible at http://localhost:4200/remoteEntry.js. After completing all steps mentioned in this document, a previously existing \"vanilla\" Angular application should be runnable as a microfrontend in OneCX. If the app additionally has to support running in standalone (e.g. in local development), a few additional steps are necessary. All steps required for running an app in standalone are covered in the separate Enable OneCX app to run in standalone cookbook. For more information on how OneCX loads microfrontends and utilizes web components for content rendering, refer to the Microfrontend Content Loading in OneCX and Web Components in OneCX pages of the OneCX Docs. If you encounter the above mentioned error you might be using multiple conflicting webpack versions in your project. To verify that this is the case, first run npm ls webpack. If this command returns a list of multiple different versions of webpack, please modify your package.json file to resolve the version mismatches (change version or install webpack dependency if it doesn’t exist yet). In our case it helped to set the version to a fixed version (5.94.0), as this was the exact version that one other package tried to use as a peer dependency.","title":"Migrate vanilla Angular apps to OneCX","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"index","url":"/documentation/current/angular/cookbook/migrations/vanilla-to-onecx/index.html","titles":[{"text":"General","hash":"general","id":1},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"prerequisites","id":2},{"text":"Migration steps","hash":"migration-steps","id":3},{"text":"Ensure that your application works as expected","hash":"ensure-functionality","id":4},{"text":"Install necessary dependencies","hash":"install-dependencies","id":5},{"text":"Refactor angular.json to use ngx-build-plus builders (Only Angular CLI)","hash":"refactor-angular-json","id":6},{"text":"Refactor project.json to enable custom bundling (Only NX)","hash":"refactor-project-json","id":7},{"text":"Create app entrypoint files","hash":"create-entrypoints","id":8},{"text":"Create app-entrypoint-component","hash":"create-entrypoint-component","id":9},{"text":"Create src/app/app-entrypoint.component.html","hash":"create-entrypoint-component-html","id":10},{"text":"Create src/app/app-entrypoint.component.ts","hash":"create-entrypoint-component-ts","id":11},{"text":"Create remote module src/app/remote.module.ts","hash":"create-entrypoint-module","id":12},{"text":"Optional: Set up @ngx-translate translation loading in the remote module","hash":"configure-remote-module-translation-loading","id":13},{"text":"Create remote-bootstrap.ts and remote-main.ts","hash":"expose-entrypoint","id":14},{"text":"Add newly created remote-main.ts to files in tsconfig","hash":"bundle-entrypoint","id":15},{"text":"Create Webpack config files","hash":"webpack-configuration","id":16},{"text":"Add environment file env.json","hash":"environment-file","id":17},{"text":"Verify that the app is exposing a remote entry point","hash":"test-remote-entrypoint","id":18},{"text":"Standalone Mode","hash":"standalone-mode","id":19},{"text":"Further Reading","hash":"further-reading","id":20},{"text":"Troubleshooting","hash":"troubleshooting","id":21},{"text":"Compilation error TypeError: The 'compilation' argument must be an instance of Compilation","hash":"troubleshooting-compilation-error","id":22}]},"49":{"id":49,"text":"Add a Calendar as a search criteria input field for your search page.

The maven wrapper is used to specify the Maven version for the public project. Please delete the maven wrapper from the project repository. We will use the maven [3.6.2,) version. But to understand the Quarkus project we will create our project from scratch. First we need to create project from template: mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:3.13.2:create \\ -DprojectGroupId={example-maven-group-id} \\ -DprojectArtifactId={example-maven-artifact-id} \\ -DprojectVersion={example-maven-version} \\ -DclassName=\"{example-maven-class-name}\" \\ -Dpath=\"/onecx-quarkus-example\" cd onecx-quarkus-example For all OneCx project we will have groupId=<maven-group-id>.<domain | subdomains> and artefactId=<project-name> The project name muss be equals the git repository name. All project will use the Conventional Commits and SemVer 2.0. The maven version of the project will be {example-maven-version} and it is not used to determine release artifact version. Minimum maven configuration for our project is this: <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <project xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\" xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"> <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion> <groupId>{example-maven-group-id}</groupId> <artifactId>{example-maven-artifact-id}</artifactId> <version>{example-maven-version}</version> <name>{example-maven-artifact-id}</name> </project> Pom file can be configured in many ways. The recommended way in our projects is to use parent pom from our repository, designed especially to use in OneCx applications. Maven parent POM (or super POM) is used to structure the project to avoid redundancies or duplicate configurations using inheritance between pom files. Maven creates a 'final POM' by merging the information from parent and module POM. In child POM we only need to include parent, additional dependencies that are not specified in the parent file and these dependencies that are specified in <dependencyManagement> section, and we want to use them. You can find more information here: More information about maven parent pom pattern Apache Maven Pom Documentation OneCx maven parent project source code repository {parent-soruce-code-url}[Link] <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <project xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\" xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"> <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion> <parent> <groupId>{example-parent-group-id}</groupId> <artifactId>{example-maven-group-id}</artifactId> <version>{example-maven-version}</version> </parent> <groupId>{example-maven-group-id}</groupId> <artifactId>{example-maven-artifact-id}</artifactId> <version>{example-maven-version}</version> <name>{example-maven-artifact-id}</name> <dependencies> <!-- project dependencies --> </dependencies> </project> If you want to create pom from scratch or have better understanding how it works, you can follow undermentioned steps. For the Quarkus application we need to add Quarkus BOM dependencies. There two possible solution: Quarkus BOM - this is base Quarkus which contains only Quarkus internal extensions. Quarkus BOM universe - this is default use with the Quarkus project generator. This BOM contains all Quarkus extension and external project like Quarkus Camel extension.

IntermediateService which implements business logic. These components are often omitted. Entity services are components taking care of data management, basically fetching storing the data from/to database Client services which are Java classes: Validation request sequence: Create user request sequence: RestController – Any class named RestController is supposed to expose API to outside world For example: UserRestController Service – (IntermediateService) the core components containing business logic, shareable piece of codes for other components usually controllers or other services as well. For example: UserValidationService Mapper - Object mapper for mapping DTO to internal models and vice versa. For example: UserMapper. DAO - Data access object (JPA entity wrapper) For example: UserDAO Each project should have own package which contains the domain of the project. All projects in the onecx context start with a package org.tkit.onecx and package <artefactId | simplified> For example our Maven project: groupId = org.tkit.onecx artefactId = onecx-quarkus-example src main java org.tkit.onecx.quarkus.example Microservice package structure: domain.models // JPA entities domain.criteria // JPA criteria domain.daos // DAO and search criteria for the entities domain.services // Common intermediate shared domain services rs // common rs classes (CORSFilter, JaxRSActivator..) rs.internal.controllers // REST controllers rs.internal.mappers // internal DTOs mappers rs.internal.services // internal intermediate services rs.external.<version>.controllers // REST controllers rs.external.<version>.logs // log mappers rs.external.<version>.mappers // external DTOs mappers rs.external.<version>.services // Intermediate services for the rest <version> interface Our org.tkit.onecx package of our example application. org.tkit.onecx quarkus example domain models // JPA entities daos // DAO for the entities services // DAO for the entities rs //common rs classes (CORSFilter, JaxRSActivator..) controllers // REST controllers internal mappers // internal DTOs mappers external <version> controllers // REST controllers mappers // external DTOs mappers For the rest-controllers we need to have two types of the rest endpoints: internal - which are us only for the internal domain, for example for UI <version | external> - these REST controllers are external interfaces to rest of the world. For these we need to have version. In the project we have defined two docker files, one for java base docker image and one for native build docker image. The source code for the base docker image can be found in the GitHub repositories docker-quarkus-native and docker-quarkus-jvm. The two Dockerfiles look like this: Dockerfile.jvm definition FROM ghcr.io/onecx/docker-quarkus-jvm:0.15.0 COPY --chown=185 target/quarkus-app/lib/ /deployments/lib/ COPY --chown=185 target/quarkus-app/*.jar /deployments/ COPY --chown=185 target/quarkus-app/app/ /deployments/app/ COPY --chown=185 target/quarkus-app/quarkus/ /deployments/quarkus/ USER 185 Dockerfile.native definition FROM ghcr.io/onecx/docker-quarkus-native:0.10.0 COPY --chown=1001:root target/*-runner /work/application Docker build configuration is defined in the maven parent project. For more information about Quarkus docker extension, please check the official documentation quarkus-container-image-docker. In the src/main/helm we muss define Chart.yaml in version v2 and values.yaml. The alias for every onecx quarkus application is app. The GitHub pipeline will replace the chart version and appVersion during the build with current service version.

Otherwise you need to manually paste the openapi file into your project and adjust your application.properties. After writing your openapi file run mvn clean package or mvn clean package -DskipTests to generate objects and your rest-controller interface into the /target folder. Controller definition and annotations @ApplicationScoped @Transactional(value = Transactional.TxType.NOT_SUPPORTED) @LogService public class ThemeRestController implements ThemesApiService { Use of client and mapper @Inject @RestClient ThemesInternalApi client; @Inject ThemeMapper mapper; @Inject ExceptionMapper exceptionMapper; Endpoint implementation /themes/search: post: x-onecx: permissions: themes: - read tags: - themes description: Search themes by criteria operationId: searchThemes requestBody: required: true content: application/json: schema: $ref: '#/components/schemas/ThemeSearchCriteria' responses: \"200\": description: Ok content: application/json: schema: $ref: '#/components/schemas/ThemePageResult' \"204\": description: No Content \"400\": description: Bad Request content: application/json: schema: $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetailResponse' \"404\": description: Not Found @Override public Response searchThemes(ThemeSearchCriteriaDTO themeSearchCriteriaDTO) { try (Response response = client.searchThemes(mapper.mapSearchCriteria(themeSearchCriteriaDTO))) { ThemePageResultDTO themePageResultDTO = mapper .pageResultMapper(response.readEntity(ThemePageResult.class)); return Response.status(response.getStatus()).entity(themePageResultDTO).build(); } } Exception handling In most cases you don’t need to handle exceptions manually. We define @ServerExceptionMapper to let quarkus automatically handle the mentioned exceptions. For this to work you need to use a custom ExceptionMapper so that the Exceptions will be converted to an equal format. You can just use the following file. package org.tkit.onecx.themes.bff.rs.mappers; import static jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON; import java.util.List; import java.util.Map; import java.util.Set; import gen.org.tkit.onecx.theme.bff.rs.internal.model.ProblemDetailInvalidParamDTO; import gen.org.tkit.onecx.theme.bff.rs.internal.model.ProblemDetailParamDTO; import gen.org.tkit.onecx.theme.bff.rs.internal.model.ProblemDetailResponseDTO; import jakarta.validation.ConstraintViolation; import jakarta.validation.ConstraintViolationException; import jakarta.validation.Path; import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Response; import org.jboss.resteasy.reactive.ClientWebApplicationException; import org.jboss.resteasy.reactive.RestResponse; import org.mapstruct.Mapper; import org.mapstruct.Mapping; import org.tkit.quarkus.rs.mappers.OffsetDateTimeMapper; import gen.org.tkit.onecx.permission.model.ProblemDetailResponse; @Mapper(uses = { OffsetDateTimeMapper.class }) public interface ExceptionMapper { default RestResponse<ProblemDetailResponseDTO> constraint(ConstraintViolationException ex) { var dto = exception(\"CONSTRAINT_VIOLATIONS\", ex.getMessage()); dto.setInvalidParams(createErrorValidationResponse(ex.getConstraintViolations())); return RestResponse.status(Response.Status.BAD_REQUEST, dto); } default Response clientException(ClientWebApplicationException ex) { if (ex.getResponse().getStatus() == 500) { return Response.status(400).build(); } else { if (ex.getResponse().getMediaType() != null && ex.getResponse().getMediaType().toString().contains(APPLICATION_JSON)) { return Response.status(ex.getResponse().getStatus()) .entity(map(ex.getResponse().readEntity(ProblemDetailResponse.class))).build(); } else { return Response.status(ex.getResponse().getStatus()).build(); } } } @Mapping(target = \"removeParamsItem\", ignore = true) @Mapping(target = \"removeInvalidParamsItem\", ignore = true) ProblemDetailResponseDTO map(ProblemDetailResponse problemDetailResponse); @Mapping(target = \"removeParamsItem\", ignore = true) @Mapping(target = \"params\", ignore = true) @Mapping(target = \"invalidParams\", ignore = true) @Mapping(target = \"removeInvalidParamsItem\", ignore = true) ProblemDetailResponseDTO exception(String errorCode, String detail); default List<ProblemDetailParamDTO> map(Map<String, Object> params) { if (params == null) { return List.of(); } return params.entrySet().stream().map(e -> { var item = new ProblemDetailParamDTO(); item.setKey(e.getKey()); if (e.getValue() != null) { item.setValue(e.getValue().toString()); } return item; }).toList(); } List<ProblemDetailInvalidParamDTO> createErrorValidationResponse( Set<ConstraintViolation<?>> constraintViolation); @Mapping(target = \"name\", source = \"propertyPath\") @Mapping(target = \"message\", source = \"message\") ProblemDetailInvalidParamDTO createError(ConstraintViolation<?> constraintViolation); default String mapPath(Path path) { return path.toString(); } } After this you can add the following to your rest-controller. @ServerExceptionMapper public RestResponse<ProblemDetailResponseDTO> constraint(ConstraintViolationException ex) { return exceptionMapper.constraint(ex); } @ServerExceptionMapper public Response restException(ClientWebApplicationException ex) { return exceptionMapper.clientException(ex); } Depending on your project, you may have more or less exceptions that need to be handled. When using multiple clients in one rest-call it’s also possible, that you need to manually handle exceptions with a catch{} block. Create a mapper for each entity. We use Mapstruct for this. Mapstruct Documentation You need to map all incoming dto’s to the svc models and the model of the svc response back to a dto. Example Mapper: @Mapper(uses = { OffsetDateTimeMapper.class }) public interface ThemeMapper { ThemeSearchCriteria mapSearchCriteria(ThemeSearchCriteriaDTO themeSearchCriteriaDTO); @Mapping(target = \"themes\", source = \"stream\") @Mapping(target = \"removeThemesItem\", ignore = true) ThemePageResultDTO pageResultMapper(ThemePageResult themePageResult); } Used in controller like this: @Override public Response searchThemes(ThemeSearchCriteriaDTO themeSearchCriteriaDTO) { try (Response response = client.searchThemes(mapper.mapSearchCriteria(themeSearchCriteriaDTO))) { ThemePageResultDTO themePageResultDTO = mapper .pageResultMapper(response.readEntity(ThemePageResult.class)); return Response.status(response.getStatus()).entity(themePageResultDTO).build(); } } Since your controller is already annotated with @LogService You can now create a custom logger. You should add each incoming object to the logger but only as little as possible and as much as necessary fields for each object. Example @ApplicationScoped public class ThemeLog implements LogParam { @Override public List<Item> getClasses() { return List.of( this.item(10, ThemeSearchCriteriaDTO.class, x -> \"ThemeSearchCriteriaDTO[ name: \" + ((ThemeSearchCriteriaDTO) x).getName() + \" ]\")); } } Make sure that you don’t add critical data to logger like passwords or tokens! To start writing unit-tests you should first create an abstract class called AbstractTest.java inside of your test package. You can copy and paste the following class. package org.tkit.onecx.themes.bff.rs; import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.ConfigProvider; import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper; import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.SerializationFeature; import com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.jsr310.JavaTimeModule; import io.quarkiverse.mockserver.test.MockServerTestResource; import io.quarkus.test.common.QuarkusTestResource; import io.restassured.RestAssured; import io.restassured.config.ObjectMapperConfig; import io.restassured.config.RestAssuredConfig; @QuarkusTestResource(MockServerTestResource.class) public abstract class AbstractTest { protected static final String ADMIN = \"alice\"; protected static final String USER = \"bob\"; protected static final String APM_HEADER_PARAM = ConfigProvider.getConfig() .getValue(\"%test.tkit.rs.context.token.header-param\", String.class); static { RestAssured.config = RestAssuredConfig.config().objectMapperConfig( ObjectMapperConfig.objectMapperConfig().jackson2ObjectMapperFactory( (cls, charset) -> { ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper(); objectMapper.registerModule(new JavaTimeModule()); objectMapper.configure(SerializationFeature.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS, false); return objectMapper; })); } } We use the @QuarkusTestResource(MockServerTestResource.class) annotation to include a mockserver for our tests. The following defined users bob and alice are later used to test the access with different sets of permissions. Alice is used as an admin with all permissions and bob as a user with just a subset of permissions. The APM_HEADER_PARAM is later used to authenticate our test requests. See more at Security & Permissions Whenever your data contains any type of dates you will also need the static RestAssured.config Otherwise the test responses will contain dates as numbers. Now, before writing tests, we will add all necessary files to make the mockserver work. Create a package called mockserver inside your test resources package. See project structure for more information. Create an empty file called internal.json in this package. This file will be used by the mockserver to save expectations whenever you create one inside your tests. Create a file called mockserver.properties inside your test.resources package. You can copy and paste the content from the following file: mockserver.properties mockserver.initializationJsonPath=/mockserver/*.json # watch changes in the file mockserver.watchInitializationJson=true # Certificate Generation # dynamically generated CA key pair (if they don't already exist in specified directory) mockserver.dynamicallyCreateCertificateAuthorityCertificate=true # save dynamically generated CA key pair in working directory mockserver.directoryToSaveDynamicSSLCertificate=. # certificate domain name (default \"localhost\") mockserver.sslCertificateDomainName=localhost # comma separated list of ip addresses for Subject Alternative Name domain names (default empty list) mockserver.sslSubjectAlternativeNameDomains=www.example.com,www.another.com # comma separated list of ip addresses for Subject Alternative Name ips (default empty list) mockserver.sslSubjectAlternativeNameIps=127.0.0.1 Add the following properties to your application.properties %test.quarkus.mockserver.devservices.config-class-path=true %test.quarkus.mockserver.devservices.config-file=/mockserver.properties %test.quarkus.mockserver.devservices.config-dir=/mockserver %test.quarkus.mockserver.devservices.log=false %test.quarkus.mockserver.devservices.reuse=true %test.quarkus.rest-client.onecx_theme_svc.url=${quarkus.mockserver.endpoint} You will need to change the last line from onecx_theme_svc to the config key of your client. This will point all test requests to your client to the mockserver. You will need this line for each client you use. Now everything is prepared to write your first test. Each rest-controller class will have its own test class. First create a new test class. By convention, you should name it like this: [RestControllerName]Test. Define your class like this: @QuarkusTest @LogService @TestHTTPEndpoint(ThemeRestController.class) class ThemeRestControllerTest extends AbstractTest { The @TestHTTPEndpoint will set the base-url of your test-request to the one of your controller. Example If you have a bff with 6 endpoints distributed to 2 controllers like: /yourBff/themes/{id} (GET) /yourBff/themes (POST) /yourBff/themes/search (POST) /yourBff/users/{id} (GET) /yourBff/users (POST) /yourBff/users/search (POST) This would result in 2 controllers. One for themes and one for users. When testing the ThemesRestController you can now make test-request to just .post(/search), .post(/{id}), .post() because the base url of your tests will already include \"/yourBff/themes\". Now instantiate a KeycloakTestClient and inject the MockServerClient: KeycloakTestClient keycloakClient = new KeycloakTestClient(); @InjectMockServerClient MockServerClient mockServerClient; Now you should also add the following @BeforeEach method to reset all mocks after each test. Since you probably want to run multiple test cases related to a single client-endpoint, this method ensures, that you don’t hit a created expectation of a before executed test by accident. static final String MOCK_ID = \"MOCK\"; @BeforeEach void resetExpectation() { try { mockServerClient.clear(MOCK_ID); } catch (Exception ex) { // mockId not existing } } You can also manually remove a created expectation in a test itself. If you need to mock multiple endpoints in a single test, you can add more mock ids to the resetExpectation() method. Make sure, that in a single test all mocks have a unique id. Otherwise, they would overwrite themselves. The following example test will test a POST \"/search\" endpoint. For a unit test you need to create a method annotated with @Test Tests should have a describing name including the expectation. For example searchThemesByCriteria() or searchThemes_missingCriteria_400() A test needs 3 main components. Expectation (Mock) mockServerClient.when(request().withPath(\"/internal/themes/search\").withMethod(HttpMethod.POST) .withBody(JsonBody.json(criteria))) .withId(MOCK_ID) .respond(httpRequest -> response().withStatusCode(Response.Status.OK.getStatusCode()) .withContentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) .withBody(JsonBody.json(data))); Request var output = given() .when() .auth().oauth2(keycloakClient.getAccessToken(ADMIN)) .header(APM_HEADER_PARAM, ADMIN) .contentType(APPLICATION_JSON) .body(searchThemeRequestDTO) .post() .then() .statusCode(Response.Status.OK.getStatusCode()) .contentType(APPLICATION_JSON) .extract().as(ThemePageResultDTO.class); Assertions Assertions.assertNotNull(output); Assertions.assertEquals(data.getSize(), output.getSize()); Assertions.assertEquals(data.getStream().size(), output.getThemes().size()); Assertions.assertEquals(data.getStream().get(0).getName(), output.getThemes().get(0).getName()); See more in this reference for an example test class. ITs ensure that everything also works when your application is containerized with docker. Create for each test class an integration test file named like: [RestControllerName]IT. Annotate this class with @QuarkusIntegrationTest and extend it by your test class. It should look like this: @QuarkusIntegrationTest public class ThemeRestControllerIT extends ThemeRestControllerTest { } Our BFFs are double secured. To activate endpoint security you need to add the following properties to the application.properties # AUTHENTICATION quarkus.http.auth.permission.health.paths=/q/* quarkus.http.auth.permission.health.policy=permit quarkus.http.auth.permission.default.paths=/* quarkus.http.auth.permission.default.policy=authenticated This will ensure, that the BFF is only accessible for requests with a valid APM token. All requests in your test file will then need .header(APM_HEADER_PARAM, ADMIN) which we already added before. To limit access based on permissions first make sure you added the following dependency to your pom. <dependency> <groupId>org.tkit.onecx.quarkus</groupId> <artifactId>onecx-permissions</artifactId> </dependency> and activated the permission generation of the openapi-generator-maven-plugin. <additionalProperties>onecx-permissions=true</additionalProperties> After that you can add permissions to each endpoint inside your openapi file: /themes/search: post: x-onecx: permissions: themes: - read We typically use read, write and delete as actions. This may vary depending on the project. Each permission is a pair of resource(entity) + action. In this example case the resource(entity) is \"themes\" and the action \"read\". After that you need to add those permissions to the values.yaml like here: app: name: bff image: repository: \"onecx/onecx-theme-bff\" operator: # Permission permission: enabled: true spec: permissions: themes: read: permission on all GET requests and POST search write: permission on PUT, POST, PATCH requests, where objects are saved or updated delete: permission on all DELETE requests keycloak: client: enabled: true spec: kcConfig: defaultClientScopes: [ ocx-th:all, ocx-pm:read ] This will trigger an operator on each deployment which creates those permissions in the permission-svc. To use those permissions in your tests you firstly need to add the following to each request. .auth().oauth2(keycloakClient.getAccessToken(ADMIN)) and this to your application.properties %test.quarkus.rest-client.onecx_permission.url=${quarkus.mockserver.endpoint} %test.quarkus.keycloak.devservices.roles.alice=role-admin %test.quarkus.keycloak.devservices.roles.bob=role-user %test.onecx.permissions.product-name=applications Finally, we need to add mocks for the permission-svc. You can copy and paste the content of the following file and save it into the mockserver folder as permissions.json and adjust it by changing the resource, in this case \"themes\", and actions if needed. permissions.json [ { \"id\": \"2\", \"httpRequest\": { \"headers\": { \"apm-principal-token\": [ \"alice\" ] }, \"path\": \"/v1/permissions/user/applications/onecx-theme-bff\" }, \"httpResponse\": { \"body\": { \"type\": \"JSON\", \"json\": { \"appId\": \"onecx-theme-bff\", \"permissions\": { \"themes\": [ \"read\", \"write\", \"delete\" ], \"permissions\": [ \"admin-write\", \"admin-read\" ] } }, \"contentType\": \"application/json\" } } }, { \"id\": \"3\", \"httpRequest\": { \"headers\": { \"apm-principal-token\": [ \"bob\" ] }, \"path\": \"/v1/permissions/user/applications/onecx-theme-bff\" }, \"httpResponse\": { \"body\": { \"type\": \"JSON\", \"json\": { \"appId\": \"onecx-theme-bff\", \"permissions\": { \"themes\": [ \"read\" ], \"permissions\": [ \"admin-write\", \"admin-read\" ] } }, \"contentType\": \"application/json\" } } } ]","title":"Backend for frontends (bff)","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"quarkus-bff","url":"/documentation/current/quarkus/quarkus-bff.html","titles":[{"text":"Project setup","hash":"_project_setup","id":1},{"text":"Parent configuration","hash":"_parent_configuration","id":2},{"text":"Dependencies","hash":"_dependencies","id":3},{"text":"application.properties","hash":"_application_properties","id":4},{"text":"OpenApi generator","hash":"_openapi_generator","id":5},{"text":"Creating a Rest-Controller","hash":"_creating_a_rest_controller","id":6},{"text":"Mapper","hash":"_mapper","id":7},{"text":"Logger","hash":"_logger","id":8},{"text":"Tests","hash":"_tests","id":9},{"text":"Mockserver","hash":"_mockserver","id":10},{"text":"Unit Tests","hash":"_unit_tests","id":11},{"text":"Integration Tests (IT)","hash":"_integration_tests_it","id":12},{"text":"Security & Permissions","hash":"_security_permissions","id":13}]},"62":{"id":62,"text":"","title":"","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"quarkus-github-actions","url":"/documentation/current/quarkus/quarkus-github-actions.html","titles":[{"text":"Quarkus GitHub Actions","hash":"_quarkus_github_actions","id":1}]},"63":{"id":63,"text":"Now that project structure is set up for the Onecx Quarkus project, we can configure the k8s operator and extend the project configuration.

First we need to defined our REST interface with openApi. Create a example-v1.yaml (pattern: <application>-<version>.yaml) in the src/main/openapi directory. Example openapi file --- openapi: 3.0.3 info: title: onecx-theme internal service version: 1.0.0 servers: - url: \"http://onecx-theme-svc:8080\" tags: - name: themesInternal paths: /internal/themes/search: post: security: - oauth2: [ ocx-th:all, ocx-th:read ] tags: - themesInternal description: Search for themes operationId: searchThemes requestBody: required: true content: application/json: schema: $ref: '#/components/schemas/ThemeSearchCriteria' responses: \"200\": description: OK content: application/json: schema: type: array items: $ref: '#/components/schemas/ThemePageResult' \"400\": description: Bad Request content: application/json: schema: $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetailResponse' components: securitySchemes: oauth2: type: oauth2 flows: clientCredentials: tokenUrl: https://oauth.simple.api/token scopes: ocx-th:all: Grants access to all operations ocx-th:read: Grants read access ocx-th:write: Grants write access ocx-th:delete: Grants access to delete operations schemas: ThemeSearchCriteria: type: object properties: name: type: string pageNumber: format: int32 description: The number of page. default: 0 type: integer pageSize: format: int32 description: The size of page default: 100 maximum: 1000 type: integer ThemePageResult: type: object properties: totalElements: format: int64 description: The total elements in the resource. type: integer number: format: int32 type: integer size: format: int32 type: integer totalPages: format: int64 type: integer stream: type: array items: $ref: '#/components/schemas/Theme' Theme: required: - name - displayName type: object properties: modificationCount: format: int32 type: integer creationDate: $ref: '#/components/schemas/OffsetDateTime' creationUser: type: string modificationDate: $ref: '#/components/schemas/OffsetDateTime' modificationUser: type: string id: type: string name: minLength: 2 type: string displayName: minLength: 2 type: string cssFile: type: string description: type: string assetsUrl: type: string logoUrl: type: string faviconUrl: type: string previewImageUrl: type: string assetsUpdateDate: type: string properties: type: object operator: type: boolean default: false OffsetDateTime: format: date-time type: string example: 2022-03-10T12:15:50-04:00 ProblemDetailResponse: type: object properties: errorCode: type: string detail: type: string params: type: array items: $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetailParam' invalidParams: type: array items: $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetailInvalidParam' ProblemDetailParam: type: object properties: key: type: string value: type: string ProblemDetailInvalidParam: type: object properties: name: type: string message: type: string Now we can configure org.tkit.onecx.quarkus:onecx-openapi-generator Maven plugin. The important part of the Maven plugin is xml configuration element. OpenApi generator full Maven plugin configuration <plugin> <groupId>org.openapitools</groupId> <artifactId>openapi-generator-maven-plugin</artifactId> <configuration> <generatorName>jaxrs-spec</generatorName> <modelNameSuffix>DTO</modelNameSuffix> <generateApiTests>false</generateApiTests> <generateApiDocumentation>false</generateApiDocumentation> <generateModelTests>false</generateModelTests> <generateModelDocumentation>false</generateModelDocumentation> <generateSupportingFiles>false</generateSupportingFiles> <addCompileSourceRoot>true</addCompileSourceRoot> <library>quarkus</library> <additionalProperties>onecx-scopes=true</additionalProperties> <configOptions> <sourceFolder>/</sourceFolder> <openApiNullable>false</openApiNullable> <returnResponse>true</returnResponse> <useTags>true</useTags> <interfaceOnly>true</interfaceOnly> <serializableModel>true</serializableModel> <singleContentTypes>true</singleContentTypes> <dateLibrary>java8</dateLibrary> <useMicroProfileOpenAPIAnnotations>true</useMicroProfileOpenAPIAnnotations> <useJakartaEe>true</useJakartaEe> <useBeanValidation>true</useBeanValidation> <java17>true</java17> </configOptions> </configuration> <executions> <execution> <id>internal</id> <goals> <goal>generate</goal> </goals> <configuration> <inputSpec>src/main/openapi/onecx-theme-internal-openapi.yaml</inputSpec> <apiPackage>gen.org.tkit.onecx.theme.rs.internal</apiPackage> <modelPackage>gen.org.tkit.onecx.theme.rs.internal.model</modelPackage> <modelNameSuffix>DTO</modelNameSuffix> </configuration> </execution> </executions> </plugin> After we run mvn clean package maven plugin will generate in corresponding source code in target/generated-sources directory. To implement the RoleRestController we need to create a java class which implements generated interface gen.org.tkit.onecx.example.rs.v1.RoleInternalApi. RoleRestController import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped; import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Response; import jakarta.validation.ConstraintViolationException; import org.tkit.quarkus.jpa.exceptions.ConstraintException; import jakarta.persistence.OptimisticLockException; import gen.org.tkit.onecx.example.rs.v1.RoleInternalApi; import gen.org.tkit.onecx.example.rs.v1.model.CreateRoleRequestDTO; @ApplicationScoped public class RoleRestController implements RoleInternalApi { @Inject RoleMapper mapper; @Inject ExceptionMapper exceptionMapper; @Context UriInfo uriInfo; @Override public Response createRole(CreateRoleRequestDTO createRoleRequestDTO) { var role = mapper.create(createRoleRequestDTO); role = dao.create(role); return Response .created(uriInfo.getAbsolutePathBuilder().path(role.getId()).build()) .entity(mapper.map(theme)) .build(); } // constraint exception exception handler @ServerExceptionMapper public RestResponse<ProblemDetailResponseDTO> exception(ConstraintException ex) { return exceptionMapper.exception(ex); } // constraint violation exception handler @ServerExceptionMapper public RestResponse<ProblemDetailResponseDTO> constraint(ConstraintViolationException ex) { return exceptionMapper.constraint(ex); } // Optimistic lock exception handler @ServerExceptionMapper public RestResponse<ProblemDetailResponseDTO> optimisticLockException(OptimisticLockException ex) { return exceptionMapper.optimisticLock(ex); } } For the backend service we need to define exception mapper methods for following exception: jakarta.persistence.OptimisticLockException - this exception is throw when try to store object in the database with old or wrong OPTLOCK number. jakarta.validation.ConstraintViolationException - when we activate a validation framework io.quarkus:quarkus-hibernate-validator this exception will be thrown when request does not match to the requirements defined in the OpenApi. org.tkit.quarkus.jpa.exceptions.ConstraintException - this exception will be thrown for any database constraints. With the annotation @ServerExceptionMapper we defined the exception mapper for each Exception in the context of the RestController. To map the request DTO object to the JPA model we use the Mapstruct. We define the RoleMapper in our example. import org.tkit.quarkus.rs.mappers.OffsetDateTimeMapper; @Mapper(uses = { OffsetDateTimeMapper.class }) public interface RoleMapper { @Mapping(target = \"id\", ignore = true) @Mapping(target = \"creationDate\", ignore = true) @Mapping(target = \"creationUser\", ignore = true) @Mapping(target = \"modificationDate\", ignore = true) @Mapping(target = \"modificationUser\", ignore = true) @Mapping(target = \"controlTraceabilityManual\", ignore = true) @Mapping(target = \"modificationCount\", ignore = true) @Mapping(target = \"persisted\", ignore = true) @Mapping(target = \"tenantId\", ignore = true) Role create(CreateRoleRequestDTO dto); // ... more mapping methods } The same approach we use for the exception mapper which could be shared between multiple RestController for the same rest interface. import org.tkit.quarkus.rs.mappers.OffsetDateTimeMapper; @Mapper(uses = { OffsetDateTimeMapper.class }) public interface ExceptionMapper { default RestResponse<ProblemDetailResponseDTO> constraint(ConstraintViolationException ex) { var dto = exception(ErrorKeys.CONSTRAINT_VIOLATIONS.name(), ex.getMessage()); dto.setInvalidParams(createErrorValidationResponse(ex.getConstraintViolations())); return RestResponse.status(Response.Status.BAD_REQUEST, dto); } //.... more mapping methods } org.tkit.quarkus.rs.mappers.OffsetDateTimeMapper mapper is predefined a mapstruct mapper for OffsetDateTime and LocalDateTime object. For our project we will use the tkit-quarkus-jpa and tkit-quarkus-jpa-models extension for Quarkus which have simple API on top of JPA. We have abstract DAO classes and abstract Entity classes which provides basic CRUD operation. For more information please read the extension tkit-quarkus-jpa documentation. <dependency> <groupId>org.tkit.quarkus.lib</groupId> <artifactId>tkit-quarkus-jpa</artifactId> </dependency> Create User entity class in the org.tkit.onecx.user.domain.models package. The entity class extend the TraceableEntity. In the entity class can use the Lombok annotation @Getter and @Setter to generate the getters and setters. Example user entity import javax.persistence.Entity; import javax.persistence.Table; import org.tkit.quarkus.jpa.models.TraceableEntity; @Entity @Table(name = \"T_USER\") public class User extends TraceableEntity { @Column(name = \"USERNAME\") private String username; } Example user DAO import org.tkit.quarkus.jpa.daos.AbstractDAO; import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped; @ApplicationScoped public class UserDAO extends AbstractDAO<User> { } In onecx project we do use the postgresql database for our backend services. quarkus.datasource.db-kind=postgresql quarkus.datasource.jdbc.max-size=30 quarkus.datasource.jdbc.min-size=10 quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation=validate quarkus.hibernate-orm.jdbc.timezone=UTC quarkus.liquibase.migrate-at-start=true quarkus.liquibase.validate-on-migrate=true The parameter quarkus.hibernate-orm.log.sql will activate the hibernate logs in the console. Liquibase is an open source tool for database schema change management. We will this framework in our example. Liquibase does have abstraction layer xml, json or yaml to support multi databases. Liquibase can generate the changes and compare our Hibernate model with existing database. For the database schema change management we do use quarkus-liquibase extension. To generate a database changes or validate the database changes we do use tkit-liquibase-plugin which is configured in the onecx-quarkus3-parent. Quarkus liquibase configuration quarkus.liquibase.migrate-at-start=true quarkus.liquibase.validate-on-migrate=true By default, liquibase does not use session lock. To activate the liquibase session lock during the start of our service we do use com.github.blagerweij:liquibase-sessionlock liquibase extension. No configuration is need to this extension. To generate the database changes run following command mvn clean compile -Pdb-diff To check if you are missing any changes run following command mvn validate -Pdb-check First, you need to configure the database server to use the UTC timezone. For example PostgreSQL default is UTC. Second, you need to set hibernate.jdbc.time_zone Hibernate property to the value of UTC. For the Quarkus application we need set key quarkus.hibernate-orm.jdbc.timezone to UTC value in the application.properties. quarkus.hibernate-orm.jdbc.timezone=UTC The date representation in the database is store in the UTC as long number. Date fields in the JPA entity represents this database date as LocalDateTime. On the another hand the DTO represents the date as ISO text. To get it running we need to create a mapper which will map the LocalDateTime to OffsetDatetime. In the mapping we should not lose the Offset/Zone information. The date representation in the JPA entity is the LocalDateTime java type and in the DTO object is the OffsetDateTime java type. Example user entity @Entity @Table(name = \"T_USER\") public class User extends TraceableEntity { private String username; private LocalDateTime date; } Example user DTO @RegisterForReflection public class UserDTO extends TraceableDTO { private String username; private OffsetDateTime date; } Example user mapper import org.tkit.quarkus.rs.mappers.OffsetDateTimeMapper; @Mapper(uses = OffsetDateTimeMapper.class) public interface UserMapper { UserDTO map(User model); User create(UserDTO dto); } In the tests we need to configure the RestAssured to use text representation of the date-time. public abstract class AbstractTest { static { RestAssured.config = RestAssuredConfig.config().objectMapperConfig( ObjectMapperConfig.objectMapperConfig().jackson2ObjectMapperFactory( (cls, charset) -> { ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper(); objectMapper.registerModule(new JavaTimeModule()); objectMapper.configure(SerializationFeature.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS, false); return objectMapper; } ) ); } } @GeneratorType(type = BidStringGenerator.class, when = GenerationTime.INSERT) @Column(name = \"CUSTOM\") String custom; import javax.persistence.Column; import org.my.group.BusinessId; @BusinessId(sequence = \"SEQ_MY_ENTITY_BID\") @Column(name = \"bid_anno\") Long bid; Follow the implementation of the custom annotation BusinessId. BusinessId import org.hibernate.annotations.ValueGenerationType; import java.lang.annotation.Retention; import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy; @ValueGenerationType(generatedBy = BusinessIdValueGeneration.class) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) public @interface BusinessId { String sequence() default \"\"; } BusinessIdValueGeneration import org.hibernate.tuple.AnnotationValueGeneration; import org.hibernate.tuple.GenerationTiming; import org.hibernate.tuple.ValueGenerator; public class BusinessIdValueGeneration implements AnnotationValueGeneration<BusinessId> { String sequence; @Override public void initialize(BusinessId annotation, Class<?> propertyType) { sequence = annotation.sequence(); } @Override public GenerationTiming getGenerationTiming() { return GenerationTiming.INSERT; } @Override public ValueGenerator<?> getValueGenerator() { return new BusinessIdGenerator(sequence); } @Override public boolean referenceColumnInSql() { return false; } @Override public String getDatabaseGeneratedReferencedColumnValue() { return null; } } BusinessIdGenerator import org.hibernate.Session; import org.hibernate.internal.SessionFactoryImpl; import org.hibernate.jdbc.ReturningWork; import org.hibernate.tuple.ValueGenerator; import java.sql.PreparedStatement; import java.sql.ResultSet; public class BusinessIdGenerator implements ValueGenerator<Long> { String sequence; BusinessIdGenerator(String sequence) { this.sequence = sequence; } @Override public Long generateValue(Session session, Object owner) { SessionFactoryImpl sessionFactory = (SessionFactoryImpl) session.getSessionFactory(); String sql = sessionFactory.getJdbcServices().getDialect().getSequenceNextValString(sequence); ReturningWork<Long> seq = connection -> { try (PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(sql); ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery()) { resultSet.next(); return resultSet.getLong(1); } }; return sessionFactory.getCurrentSession().doReturningWork(seq); } } We need to add the sequence to the import.sql for the local development. CREATE SEQUENCE IF NOT EXISTS seq_my_entity_bid; @GeneratorType(type = BidStringGenerator.class, when = GenerationTime.INSERT) @Column(name = \"CUSTOM\") String custom; Follow the implementation of the custom generator BidStringGenerator. public class BidStringGenerator implements ValueGenerator<String> { @Override public String generateValue(Session session, Object owner) { MyEntity e = (MyEntity) owner; return e.name + \"+\" + UUID.randomUUID(); } } For the test we add following dependencies to our project Test dependencies <dependencies> <!-- TEST --> <dependency> <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId> <artifactId>quarkus-junit5</artifactId> <scope>test</scope> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId> <artifactId>quarkus-junit5-mockito</artifactId> <scope>test</scope> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId> <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId> <scope>test</scope> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.tkit.quarkus.lib</groupId> <artifactId>tkit-quarkus-test-db-import</artifactId> <scope>test</scope> </dependency> </dependencies> The Quarkus tests has support for the injection and mocking. This will work only for the Quarkus JVM tests and not for native image test or integration tests with a docker image. Try to avoid this in our tests to have much more reusable tests. In most cases, the mock service also fakes code to pass the test. For our test we will use this pattern for the test classes <Name>RestControllerTest extends AbstractTest - the extended test for the common and unit test. For example: UserRestControllerTest <Name>RestControllerTestIT extends <Name>RestControllerTest - the extended test for the integration test. For example: UserRestControllerTestIT The 1000kit test extension tkit-quarkus-test-db-import does have support to import test data for the tests during the test execution. We will create our test data as XML data. Store the xml file in the src/test/resources/data directory under name test-internal.xml. The magic is in the @WithDBData annotation which could be used on the Class or Method level. Example of the xml test data file: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <dataset> <ROLE guid=\"r21\" optlock=\"0\" name=\"n1\" /> <ROLE guid=\"r22\" optlock=\"0\" name=\"n2\" /> </dataset> Only the XML DbUnit FlatXmlDataSet format is supported. Example of the RoleRestControllerTest class. @QuarkusTest @TestHTTPEndpoint(RoleRestController.class) @WithDBData(value = \"data/test-internal.xml\", deleteBeforeInsert = true, deleteAfterTest = true, rinseAndRepeat = true) class RoleRestControllerTest extends AbstractTest { @Test void getRoleByIdTest() { // get role by ID var dto = given().contentType(APPLICATION_JSON).get(\"r12\") .then().statusCode(OK.getStatusCode()).contentType(APPLICATION_JSON) .extract().body().as(RoleDTO.class); // validate role assertThat(dto).isNotNull(); assertThat(dto.getName()).isEqualTo(\"n2\"); assertThat(dto.getId()).isEqualTo(\"r12\"); // not found given().contentType(APPLICATION_JSON).get(\"___\").then().statusCode(NOT_FOUND.getStatusCode()); } } Example of the role rest controller integration test. import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusIntegrationTest; @QuarkusIntegrationTest class RoleRestControllerTestIT extends RoleRestControllerTest { } To enable scope security for backend services we need to add these Maven dependencies. <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId> <artifactId>quarkus-oidc</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.tkit.onecx.quarkus</groupId> <artifactId>onecx-security</artifactId> </dependency> </dependencies> The next step is to add the OAuth scopes to our OpenApi definition. In our example, we add the read scope to the createRole method. Example openapi with scope openapi: 3.0.3 info: title: example service version: 1.0.0 servers: - url: \"http://onecx-example-svc:8080\" paths: /internal/roles: get: security: - oauth2: [read] operationId: createRole responses: 201: description: \"Role created\" components: securitySchemes: oauth2: type: oauth2 flows: clientCredentials: tokenUrl: https://oauth.simple.api/token scopes: read: Grants read access Now we need to add the extension org.tkit.onecx.quarkus:onecx-openapi-generator which will generate the Quarkus annotation @io.quarkus.security.PermissionsAllowed for the security interceptor from our open API definition file. We add this extension as a dependency for the Maven plugin org.openapitools:openapi-generator-maven-plugin. <plugin> <groupId>org.openapitools</groupId> <artifactId>openapi-generator-maven-plugin</artifactId> <configuration> <additionalProperties>onecx-scopes=true</additionalProperties> <!-- configuration --> </configuration> <executions><!-- executions --></executions> <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>org.tkit.onecx.quarkus</groupId> <artifactId>onecx-openapi-generator</artifactId> </dependency> </dependencies> </plugin> To enable this extension, we also need to define additional properties onecx-scopes=true. Without this configuration, the generator uses the default Java source code template. Now our generated source code contains the annotation @io.quarkus.security.PermissionsAllowed({\"read\"}) to the generated method. public interface RoleInternalApi { @io.quarkus.security.PermissionsAllowed({ \"read\" }) @GET @Consumes({ \"application/json\" }) @Produces({ \"application/json\" }) Response createRole(); } The org.tkit.onecx.quarkus:onecx-security extension creates security audit data for the default Quarkus security extension during the build process. After enabling this extension, it is no longer possible to call this method without a token and with the scope read. To disable security setup following property tkit.security.auth.enabled=false. This property is part fo (tkit-quarkus-url)[1000kit Quarkus extension] For testing we use Quarkus Keycloak dev services. To activate this feature add this maven dependency. <dependency> <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId> <artifactId>quarkus-test-keycloak-server</artifactId> <scope>test</scope> </dependency> Quarkus will start and configure a Keycloak server for our tests but also in the dev mode by default. Now we can configure user and they roles. For example, we add role role-admin to user alice in our example # Enabled security for all requests /* and exclude /q/* quarkus console quarkus.http.auth.permission.health.paths=/q/* quarkus.http.auth.permission.health.policy=permit quarkus.http.auth.permission.default.paths=/* quarkus.http.auth.permission.default.policy=authenticated # TEST %test.quarkus.keycloak.devservices.roles.alice=role-admin %test.quarkus.keycloak.devservices.roles.bob=role-user # DEV %dev.quarkus.keycloak.devservices.roles.alice=role-admin %dev.quarkus.keycloak.devservices.roles.bob=role-user How to import the whole realm or configure additional user in to Keycloak dev services please check the Quarkus documentation page. Now we can use the io.quarkus.test.keycloak.client.KeycloakTestClient in our test. Example test class @QuarkusTest @TestHTTPEndpoint(RoleRestController.class) class RoleRestControllerTest { // create keycloak client instance connected to keycloak dev service container KeycloakTestClient keycloakClient = new KeycloakTestClient(); @Test void oauthTest() { // get the access token of the user alice var token = keycloakClient.getAccessToken(\"alice\"); // call rest endpoint given().when() .auth().oauth2(token) .contentType(APPLICATION_JSON).get(\"1\").then() .statusCode(Response.Status.OK.getStatusCode()); // test without oauth token given().when().contentType(APPLICATION_JSON).get(\"1\").then() .statusCode(Response.Status.UNAUTHORIZED.getStatusCode()); } } For multi tenancy we will to use onecx-quarkus-tenant extension. For more information about the configuration please check the documentation page onecx-quarkus-tenant Multi tenancy maven dependencies <dependencies> <!-- ONECX --> <dependency> <groupId>org.tkit.onecx.quarkus</groupId> <artifactId>onecx-tenant</artifactId> </dependency> <!-- 1000kit --> <dependency> <groupId>org.tkit.quarkus.lib</groupId> <artifactId>tkit-quarkus-jpa</artifactId> </dependency> </dependencies> Now we need to configure our application # hibernate multi-tenant configuration quarkus.hibernate-orm.multitenant=DISCRIMINATOR # enable or disable multi-tenancy support tkit.rs.context.tenant-id.enabled=true Header configuration for the token, and token parsing is implemented in 1000kit tkit-rest-context quarkus extensions. Please check the documentation of the extension. For the test we can use mock settings where we can define which claim attribute of the token we will use: %test.tkit.rs.context.tenant-id.mock.claim-org-id=orgId and we must define mapping between token claim value and tenant ID %test.tkit.rs.context.tenant-id.mock.data.<claim-value>=<tenant-id>. %test.tkit.rs.context.tenant-id.enabled=true %test.tkit.rs.context.tenant-id.mock.enabled=true %test.tkit.rs.context.tenant-id.mock.default-tenant=default %test.tkit.rs.context.tenant-id.mock.claim-org-id=orgId %test.tkit.rs.context.tenant-id.mock.data.org1=tenant-100 %test.tkit.rs.context.tenant-id.mock.data.org2=tenant-200 For the test we can create a simple help method which will creates a token for our tests @SuppressWarnings(\"java:S2187\") public class AbstractTest { // header ID of the principal token for tests protected static final String APM_HEADER_PARAM = \"apm-principal-token\"; // token claim for tenant-id protected static final String CLAIMS_ORG_ID = ConfigProvider.getConfig() .getValue(\"%test.tkit.rs.context.tenant-id.mock.claim-org-id\", String.class); /** * Method creates a principal token for test. * @param organizationId organization ID * @return the corresponding test */ protected static String createToken(String organizationId) { try { String userName = \"test-user\"; JsonObjectBuilder claims = Json.createObjectBuilder(); claims.add(Claims.preferred_username.name(), userName); claims.add(Claims.sub.name(), userName); claims.add(CLAIMS_ORG_ID, organizationId); PrivateKey privateKey = KeyUtils.generateKeyPair(2048).getPrivate(); return Jwt.claims(claims.build()).sign(privateKey); } catch (Exception ex) { throw new RuntimeException(ex); } } } In our test we can use createToken method to create a token @QuarkusTest @TestHTTPEndpoint(ExampleRestController.class) class ExampleRestControllerTenantTest extends AbstractTest { @Test void createNewThemeTest() { var dto = given() .when() .contentType(APPLICATION_JSON) .header(APM_HEADER_PARAM, createToken(\"org1\")) .body(themeDto) .post() .then() .statusCode(CREATED.getStatusCode()) .extract() .body().as(ExampleDTO.class); } }","title":"Backend service (svc)","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"quarkus-svc","url":"/documentation/current/quarkus/quarkus-svc.html","titles":[{"text":"Project setup","hash":"_project_setup","id":1},{"text":"Parent configuration","hash":"_parent_configuration","id":2},{"text":"Dependencies","hash":"_dependencies","id":3},{"text":"Generate rest endpoint","hash":"_generate_rest_endpoint","id":4},{"text":"REST Implementation","hash":"_rest_implementation","id":5},{"text":"JPA layer implementation","hash":"_jpa_layer_implementation","id":6},{"text":"Database configuration","hash":"_database_configuration","id":7},{"text":"Database schema change management","hash":"_database_schema_change_management","id":8},{"text":"JPA date-time","hash":"_jpa_date_time","id":9},{"text":"JPA custom business ID","hash":"_jpa_custom_business_id","id":10},{"text":"PostgresSQL SERIAL type","hash":"_postgressql_serial_type","id":11},{"text":"Generic sequence implementation","hash":"_generic_sequence_implementation","id":12},{"text":"Custom in-Memory generator","hash":"_custom_in_memory_generator","id":13},{"text":"Tests","hash":"_tests","id":14},{"text":"Security","hash":"_security","id":15},{"text":"Security tests","hash":"_security_tests","id":16},{"text":"Multi tenancy","hash":"_multi_tenancy","id":17},{"text":"Multi tenancy tests","hash":"_multi_tenancy_tests","id":18}]},"66":{"id":66,"text":"","title":"","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"attributes","url":"/documentation/current/quarkus/includes/attributes.html","titles":[]},"67":{"id":67,"text":"Sometimes the business case requires that the set timer needs to be manually canceled so that the process can continue further.

Here the best practices on creating of correlation key taken from (book Practical process automation use UUID for correlation ID don’t use process instance ID avoid using business data that are not unique within the cluster The correlation key have to be unique within the cluster to assure that the message is catched by the right process. The following situations show how the matching of message and process instance is done when the correlation key is the same. When several process instances within a one process are running and subscribe for a message, the message is correlated only once to one of them. Other instances remain waiting (unless not handled in a process differently). See process instance modification for possibilities to repair a running process instance. Processes with different BPMN Process IDs are independend different processes. By creation of multiple subscriptions with the same correlation key from different processes, a message is correlated within each process (once within one BPMN process ID) to only one process instance from all existing ones. When a process is deployed, it receives a version number. After making changes to the process and re-deployment, the process version is increased, the BPMN Process ID remains the same as before. Instances can be created for any of these versions. There might be two process instances of the same process but with different versions created when: one version of a process is deployed and an instance is created the process was changed and deployed again the process with the same BPMN Process ID but different version is created an instance is created A message is correlated only once to a process (once within one BPMN process ID), across all versions of this process.

Note that: If you have chosen a custom resource name in the generation, the schema entry will be named accordingly All data displayed in the results must be in that data structure Stick to necessary properties only to keep the payload small Adapt in File: <feature>-bff.yaml Example: <Feature>: type: object required: - 'modificationCount' - 'id' properties: modificationCount: type: integer format: int32 id: type: integer format: int64 houseType: type: string Where houseType is an additional property added to the schema of the entity <Feature>.

Remove the \"ACTION\" comment after working on this task The next step is to configure the columns of the search results table. Here you can define which properties of your entity should be displayed in the results table, as well as their characteristics (e.g., if they are sortable or filterable). Adapt in File: <feature>-search.columns.ts .Example: export const FeatureSearchColumns: DataTableColumn[] = [ { columnType: ColumnType.TRANSLATION_KEY, id: 'houseType', nameKey: 'FEATURE_SEARCH.COLUMNS.HOUSETYPE', filterable: true, sortable: true, predefinedGroupKeys: [ 'FEATURE_SEARCH.PREDEFINED_GROUP.DEFAULT', 'FEATURE_SEARCH.PREDEFINED_GROUP.EXTENDED', 'FEATURE_SEARCH.PREDEFINED_GROUP.FULL', ], }, { columnType: ColumnType.STRING, id: 'city', nameKey: 'FEATURE_SEARCH.COLUMNS.CITY', filterable: true, sortable: true, predefinedGroupKeys: [ 'FEATURE_SEARCH.PREDEFINED_GROUP.EXTENDED', 'FEATURE_SEARCH.PREDEFINED_GROUP.FULL', ], } ] In this example, a column for the property houseType is added to the results table. The column is of type TRANSLATION_KEY, is filterable and sortable. Additionally, a column for the property city is added, which is of type STRING, filterable, sortable, and belongs to only two predefined groups. A predefined group allows users to quickly switch between different sets of columns in the UI using a dropdown. By configuring the predefinedGroupKeys, you can define which columns belong to which groups. The key is at the same time the translation key for the group name. Refer to the DataTableColumn overview for more information. Remove the \"ACTION\" comment after working on this task Here you can create a mapping of your Resource to the row item used in the data table. This is also the place to add translation keys for columns with the type TRANSLATION_KEY.

Before proceeding, make sure you have read the following documentation: Running OneCX locally Running custom applications locally These resources provide essential background on setting up a local OneCX environment and running custom applications. This guide assumes you already know how to start OneCX locally and how to replace application images with local versions. To begin making changes and contributing to the libraries: Fork the repository: https://github.com/onecx/onecx-portal-ui-libs Important: Do not just copy the main branch. You may need to work on other branches like v5 to apply changes to older library versions. Clone your fork to your local machine. The command below assumes that you named your fork onecx-portal-ui-libs: git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/onecx-portal-ui-libs Navigate to the cloned repository directory and install dependencies: cd onecx-portal-ui-libs && npm i Open the project in your preferred code editor (e.g., VSCode) and make your desired changes. Checkpoint At this point you should have…​ a fork of the onecx-portal-ui-libs repository in your GitHub account. a local clone of said fork on your machine. installed all dependencies using npm i. made some changes to the codebase. To test your changes, the libraries must be built and copied into the node_modules folders of both the shell and the app(s) you want to test in. While it’s technically possible to only copy the changes to the node_modules folders of the shell in certain situations, we recommend you always copy the changes to both shell and the app(s) to avoid issues during dependency sharing. Complete the following steps to test your changes: Before copying the built libraries, you first need to decide which application(s) you want to test the changes in. After deciding on the application(s), you need to determine the relative paths from the root of onecx-portal-ui-libs to both the application(s) and your local clone of onecx-shell-ui. The relative paths will be used later and might look something like this: For the app(s), e.g.: ../../apps/my-cool-app For your local clone of onecx-shell-ui, e.g.: ../onecx-shell-ui Create an empty file named .copy-build-to in the root of onecx-portal-ui-libs. This file will contain the paths to the node_modules folders that the build output should be copied to. The file can contain multiple paths, one per line. Each path must be relative to the root of onecx-portal-ui-libs and must point to the @onecx folder inside the node_modules folder of the target project. For now, leave the file empty. You will add the paths in the next step. Use the relative paths from step 1 and follow these patterns: Append /node_modules/@onecx to the app path. Example: ../../apps/my-cool-app/node_modules/@onecx Note: Do not add a trailing /. Identify the library version you’re testing: v5.x.x → changes made on v5 or branches based on v5 v6.x.x → changes made on main or branches based on main Copy only to the Angular 18 pre-loader by appending /pre_loaders/angular-18/node_modules/@onecx to the shell path. Example: ../onecx-shell-ui/pre_loaders/angular-18/node_modules/@onecx Copy to both Angular 19 pre-loader and shell’s root node_modules by appending /pre_loaders/angular-19/node_modules/@onecx and /node_modules/@onecx to the shell path. Example: ../onecx-shell-ui/pre_loaders/angular-19/node_modules/@onecx ../onecx-shell-ui/node_modules/@onecx Note: Similar to apps, do not add a trailing / to any of the paths. Checkpoint At this point, your .copy-build-to file should contain two or more paths (shell + at least one app), each on a new line, pointing to the @onecx folder inside the node_modules folder of the target projects (apps and/or shell). The file might look something like this: ../../apps/my-cool-app/node_modules/@onecx ../onecx-shell-ui/pre_loaders/angular-19/node_modules/@onecx ../onecx-shell-ui/node_modules/@onecx Once you have correctly set up the .copy-build-to file, you are ready to build and copy the libraries to the specified paths. Before building, make sure to remove potentially outdated cached builds by running: rm -rf dist .nx/cache Afterwards, build and copy the libraries by running: npm run build-copy Checkpoint At this point, you should see terminal output indicating that the libraries have been built and copied to the specified paths. If you encounter any errors, refer to any error messages and ensure that the paths in the .copy-build-to file are correct. Before running the shell and app(s) with the locally built libraries, you need to make some adjustments to ensure the local versions are used correctly: Open the package.json files of each app, pre-loader, and shell that libraries were copied to. Increase the version numbers of all OneCX packages to simulate a version update. Ideally, you should use the version number your changes will be released in. Any version number higher than the current one should, however, work. Make sure to use the same version number for all OneCX packages within the project starting with 6. for v6.x.x or 5. for v5.x.x. Do not run npm install after changing the version numbers. Before running the app(s) (non-shell) delete any build caches to ensure a clean build environment. Delete build caches: rm -rf dist .nx/cache .angular Before running the shell delete the build caches of both the respective pre-loader (18 or 19) and the shell itself to ensure a clean build environment. Example for v6.x.x (Angular 19): rm -rf pre_loaders/angular-19/dist pre_loaders/angular-19/.nx/cache dist .nx/cache Checkpoint At this point, you should have updated the version numbers in the package.json files of the shell and app(s) where the libraries were copied to. Additionally, you should have deleted any build caches to ensure a clean build environment. After completing the previous steps, you are now ready to run OneCX Shell and the app(s) with your local library changes. To do so, follow the documentation on running custom applications locally. The steps for running the shell should match the steps for running existing OneCX core apps.","title":"Local Development","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"local-development","url":"/documentation/current/contributions/local-development.html","titles":[{"text":"Making changes to the libraries","hash":"making-changes-to-the-libraries","id":1},{"text":"Testing the changes locally","hash":"testing-the-changes-locally","id":2},{"text":"1.

This component displays the search result data as a diagram. Please, visit the storybook page for the SearchHeader component and interact with the examples to find out if the component is suitable for the desired use-case. The SearchHeader component allows for content customization: define header title add input fields add header actions buttons *ocxAdvanced directive The *ocxAdvanced directive specifies whether a field is part of the basic or advanced mode. This mode can be toggled using the Basic\\|Advanced button in the search header which is only displayed when this directive is used for defining advanced input fields. The directive will be added to the div element: <form [formGroup]=\"criteriaGroup\"> <div class=\"grid mt-0 p-fluid\"> <div *ocxAdvanced class=\"col-12 md:col-3\"> <span class=\"p-float-label\"> // PLACE YOUR INPUT FIELD HERE </span> </div> ... To find out how to work with the SearchHeader component, please visit the storybook page and interact with the examples to find out the required features. For more in-depth information on the SearchHeader component interface, please read the further documentation. The *ocxBasic and *ocxAdvanced directives are structural directives that provide advanced search field visibility control within the SearchHeader component. These directives enable the creation of a two-tier search interface where fields can be categorized as either basic or advanced. Here’s a simple example showing how to use the directives: <ocx-search-header ...> <form [formGroup]=\"criteriaForm\" class=\"flex flex-wrap gap-3\"> <span class=\"p-float-label\"> <input id=\"title\" ...> <label for=\"title\">Title</label> </span> <span *ocxBasic class=\"p-float-label\"> <p-multiSelect id=\"status\" ...> </p-multiSelect> <label for=\"status\">Status</label> </span> <span *ocxAdvanced class=\"p-float-label\"> <p-multiSelect id=\"priority\" ...> </p-multiSelect> <label for=\"priority\">Priority</label> </span> </form> </ocx-search-header> Basic Mode: Fields marked with *ocxAdvanced are hidden by default and only basic fields and fields without directive are visible. (Here: only Title and Status visible) Advanced Mode: All fields without an directive or with *ocxAdvanced are visible.

The library should not be used anymore and every application should make sure to update application styles. Since version 6 of OneCX, the @onecx/portal-integration-angular library is no longer available. The list of features that are still supported in other libraries and alternative solutions can be found in the removed from @onecx/portal-integration-interface section. It is important to replace PortalCoreModule if used in the application to preserve existing functionality. Please, alongside @angular and @onecx package upgrades, make sure to update the following packages to avoid potential issues: Package Required version @ngx-translate/core ^16.0.0 @ngx-translate/http-loader ^8.0.0 ngx-build-plus ^19.0.0 Please, make sure to remove @onecx/portal-layout-styles and @onecx/portal-integration-interface references from application styles. Since version 6 styles from @onecx/portal-layout-styles will no longer be available globally on a page. Please, make sure that your application does not use any styles (css classes, animations, etc.) defined by portal-layout-styles. In case it does, you will need to implement those in your application. The only css styles available for each application since version 6: styles exposed via app_url/styles.css file (where app_url is a url to the deployed application) component styles defined in the application (styles defined for each component inside the application) PrimeNG component styles (only if the application uses primeNG) In case if your application needs to share styles between components you should make sure to expose styles.css file. Shell will assume that this file is called styles.css and is exposed on the top level of your deployed application. In order to make sure this is done properly, we are recommending to update the project configuration with the following config: project.json or angular.json ... \"styles\": [ { \"input\": \"./src/styles.scss\", \"bundleName\": \"styles\", \"inject\": true } ] ... The snippet above assumes that the exposed style sheet is in src/styles.scss. Setting the inject property to true might lead to hashing, meaning the exposed file would be called styles.HASH.css, where HASH is a generated hash value during the project building. If this applies to your application, make sure to adjust the exposal so the hash is not included. If your application was using PortalCoreModule from @onecx/portal-integration-angular, you should replace all occurrences with AngularAcceleratorModule from @onecx/angular-accelerator. This will make sure that all components and directives are working. Some components will be removed. Please check if you are using following components: createRemoteComponentTranslateLoader createRemoteComponentAndMfeTranslateLoader ⇒ Use createTranslateLoader with remoteComponentTranslationPathFactory from @onecx/angular-utils createTranslateLoader ⇒ Use createTranslateLoader with translationPathFactory from @onecx/angular-utils HasPermissionChecker AlwaysGrantPermissionChecker TranslationCacheService AsyncTranslateLoader CachingTranslateLoader TranslateCombinedLoader HAS_PERMISSION_CHECKER (injection token) ⇒ Import from @onecx/angular-utils DataLoadingErrorComponent (ocx-data-loading-error) isValidDate ⇒ Removed from the library provideAppServiceMock ⇒ Use provideAppStateServiceMock IAuthService AUTH_SERVICE (injection token) ⇒ Removed from the library BASE_URL (injection token) ⇒ Use REMOTE_COMPONENT_CONFIG from @onecx/angular-utils PortalCoreModule ⇒ This module has to be replaced by AngularAcceleratorModule ColumnGroupSelectionComponent (ocx-column-group-selection) CustomGroupColumnSelectorComponent (ocx-custom-group-column-selector) DataLayoutSelectionComponent (ocx-data-layout-selection) DataListGridComponent (ocx-data-list-grid) DataListGridSortingComponent (ocx-data-list-grid-sorting) DataTableComponent (ocx-data-table) DataViewComponent (ocx-data-view) DiagramComponent (ocx-diagram) FilterViewComponent (ocx-filter-view) GroupByCountDiagramComponent (ocx-group-by-count-diagram) InteractiveDataViewComponent (ocx-interactive-data-view) LifecycleComponent (ocx-lifecycle) PageHeaderComponent (ocx-page-header) SearchHeaderComponent (ocx-search-header) DialogMessageContentComponent DialogInlineComponent (ocx-dialog-inline) DialogFooterComponent (ocx-dialog-footer) DialogContentComponent (ocx-dialog-content ) GlobalErrorComponent (ocx-error) LoadingIndicatorComponent (ocx-loading-indicator) LoadingIndicatorDirective (ocxLoadingIndicator) BasicDirective (ocxBasic) RelativeDatePipe (relativeDate) AdvancedDirective (ocxAdvanced) OcxContentContainerDirective (ocxContentContainer) OcxContentDirective (ocxContent) IfBreakpointDirective (ocxIfBreakpoint) IfPermissionDirective (ocxIfPermission, ocxIfNotPermission) SrcDirective (ocxSrc) TooltipOnOverflowDirective (ocxTooltipOnOverflow) ExportDataService PortalDialogService ImageLogoUrlUtils DialogContentHarness DialogFooterHarness DialogInlineHarness DialogMessageContentHarness ⇒ These components are now in @onecx/angular-accelerator PortalPageComponent (ocx-portal-page) ⇒ These components are now in @onecx/angular-utils PortalFooterComponent (portal-footer ) PortalHeaderComponent (portal-header) PortalViewportComponent (portal-viewport) ⇒ These components are now in @onecx/shell-core PortalMenuComponent (portal-menu) PortalMenuHorizontalComponent (portal-menu-horizontal) AppInlineProfileComponent (inline-profile) ⇒ They are now remote components in onecx-workspace-ui AnnouncementBannerComponent (ocx-announcement-banner) AnnouncementsApiService ⇒ Now remote components in onecx-announcement-ui HelpItemEditorComponent (ocx-help-item-editor) NoHelpItemComponent (ocx-no-help-item) HelpPageAPIService ⇒ Now remote components in onecx-help-ui UserAvatarComponent (ocx-user-avatar) UserProfileAPIService ⇒ Now remote components in onecx-user-profile-ui DataViewControlsComponent (ocx-data-view-controls) ⇒ Consider using the InteractiveDataViewComponent (ocx-interactive-data-view) from @onecx/angular-accelerator PageContentComponent (ocx-page-content) ⇒ Consider using the OcxContentComponent (ocx-content) or OcxContentContainerComponent (ocx-content-container) from @onecx/angular-accelerator SearchCriteriaComponent (ocx-search-criteria) CriteriaTemplateComponent (ocx-criteria-template) ⇒ Consider using the SearchHeaderComponent (ocx-search-header) from @onecx/angular-accelerator standaloneInitializer ⇒ Use standalone mode instead Documentation ButtonDialogComponent(ocx-button-dialog) ⇒ This component should be replaced by ocx-dialog-inline in @onecx/angular-accelerator MenuService ⇒ If someone wants to load menu item they should create an endpoint in the BFF of the own app and create their own function. Every other feature that is not mentioned was removed and is no longer supported. filterForOnlyQueryParamsChanged ⇒ Use filterOutOnlyQueryParamsChanged filterForQueryParamsChanged ⇒ Use filterOutQueryParamsHaveNotChanged PortalFooterComponent (ocx-shell-footer) ⇒ Now remote component in onecx-workspace-ui In version 6 of OneCX @onecx/standalone-shell library has been renamed to @onecx/angular-standalone-shell. Please, make sure that all imports, package.json and webpack config are adjusted accordingly. Additionally, since version 6, apart from StandaloneShellModule import it is required to add provideStandaloneProviders in the standalone module providers array. Please, make sure to adjust the standalone module. updated-app-standalone.module.ts example import { StandaloneShellModule, provideStandaloneProviders } from '@onecx/angular-standalone-shell' ... @NgModule({ imports: [StandaloneShellModule] providers: [ provideStandaloneProviders() ] }) export class AppModule {} Please, make sure to update FilterType usage: FilterType.EQUAL → FilterType.EQUALS FilterType.TRUTHY → FilterType.IS_NOT_EMPTY ConfigurationService (@onecx/angular-integration-interface) is now asynchronous. Please check if usage needs to be adapted. ThemeService in version 6 should only be used to access the currentTheme via currentTheme$ property. The following have been removed: baseUrlV1 property getThemeRef function loadAndApplyTheme function apply function Please, make sure that those methods are no longer used. BASE_URL injection token should no longer be used, instead please use REMOTE_COMPONENT_CONFIG Make sure that all angular packages do not have singleton: true set in webpack.config.js. For each Remote Component translation related providers are required to be defined in the bootstrap.ts instead of the component.ts file. remote-component.bootstrap.ts import { bootstrapRemoteComponent } from '@onecx/angular-webcomponents' import { REMOTE_COMPONENT_CONFIG, RemoteComponentConfig, provideTranslateServiceForRoot } from '@onecx/angular-remote-components' import { TranslateLoader } from '@ngx-translate/core' import { ReplaySubject } from 'rxjs' import { createTranslateLoader, remoteComponentTranslationPathFactory, provideTranslationPathFromMeta } from '@onecx/angular-utils' bootstrapRemoteComponent(RemoteComponent, 'ocx-my-remote-component', environment.production, [ ... { provide: REMOTE_COMPONENT_CONFIG, useValue: new ReplaySubject<RemoteComponentConfig>(1) }, provideTranslateServiceForRoot({ isolate: true, loader: { provide: TranslateLoader, useFactory: createTranslateLoader, deps: [HttpClient] } }), provideTranslationPathFromMeta(import.meta.url, 'assets/i18n/') ]) If the error \"Cannot construct translation path from local file path. Please check whether the webpack configuration for importMeta is correct: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#moduleparserjavascriptimportmeta\" appears, it means either the provider is used in the application and import.meta.url incorrectly resolves to a local file:// path. or the application does not use provideTranslationPathFromMeta, but is likely using a newer Angular version than the shell or preloader. In this case, modules are loaded from the app’s context, which also leads to a local file:// prefix. To fix this, this line has to be added to module.exports in the webpack.config.js: webpack.config.ts module.exports = { ... module: { parser: { javascript: { importMeta: false } } }, } With the removal of addInitializeModuleGuard(), the translations will be provided by the TranslationConnectionService. Please add the provideTranslationConnectionService() in the provider of your .module.ts. If you already import AngularAcceleratorModule, then it is not necessary, because it is already added there. Since version 6 it’s required to add the following plugin to the webpack configuration of the application. Webpack plugin snippet const { ModifySourcePlugin, ReplaceOperation } = require('modify-source-webpack-plugin') ... const modifyPrimeNgPlugin = new ModifySourcePlugin({ rules: [ { test: (module) => { return module.resource && module.resource.includes('primeng') }, operations: [ new ReplaceOperation( 'all', 'document\\\\.createElement\\\\(([^)]+)\\\\)', 'document.createElementFromPrimeNg({\"this\": this, \"arguments\": Array.from(arguments), element: $1})' ), new ReplaceOperation('all', 'Theme.setLoadedStyleName', '(function(_){})') ] } ] }) module.exports = { ...webpackConfig, plugins: [...plugins, modifyPrimeNgPlugin] } Since version 6 of OneCX it is required to add an additional provider to the Microfrontends and Remote Components. mfe.remote.module.ts import { provideThemeConfig } from '@onecx/angular-utils' ... @NgModule({ providers: [ provideThemeConfig() ] }) export class MyMfe {} remote-component.bootstrap.ts import { provideThemeConfig } from '@onecx/angular-utils' bootstrapRemoteComponent(RemoteComponent, 'my-remote-component', environment.production, [ provideThemeConfig() ]) The new theming system introduced in version 6 of OneCX is based on PrimeNG’s theming mechanism. However, in OneCX it is possible to style the content differently per Application. The mechanism that allows that is called theme overrides. Each Mfe or Remote Component can specify their overrides that will guarantee that certain styles are applied differently than in other applications on the page. Here is an example of how to provide overrides. provideThemeConfig({ overrides: { semantic: { extend: { onecx: { secondaryColor: 'red' }, }, focusRing: { width: '2px', style: 'solid', color: '{primary.color}', offset: '0px', shadow: 'none', }, } } }) In this example: the secondary color theme variable is changed the default focus highlight is changed More about what and how to override can be found in theming documentation. Since version 6 it’s required to add the following plugin to the webpack configuration of the application. Webpack plugin snippet const { ModifySourcePlugin, ReplaceOperation } = require('modify-source-webpack-plugin') ... const modifyMaterialPlugin = new ModifySourcePlugin({ rules: [ { test: (module) => { return ( module.resource && (module.resource.includes(\"@angular/material\") || module.resource.includes(\"@angular/cdk\")) ); }, operations: [ new ReplaceOperation( \"all\", \"document\\\\.createElement\\\\(\", 'document.createElementFromMaterial({\"this\": this, \"arguments\": Array.from(arguments)},', ), ], } ] }) module.exports = { ...webpackConfig, plugins: [...plugins, modifyMaterialPlugin] } Make sure to adjust the Application to the Angular 19 requirements. Based on the implementation there could be changes required to be made to ensure compatibility. If the migrated Application uses PrimeNG components, please make sure to adjust the implementation according to the PrimeNG 19 requirements and API changes.","title":"Migrate to OneCX version 6","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"migrate-to-v6","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-portal-ui-libs/migrations/migrate-to-v6.html","titles":[{"text":"Migration checklist","hash":"migration-checklist","id":1},{"text":"General changes","hash":"general-changes","id":2},{"text":"Removed packages","hash":"removed-packages","id":3},{"text":"Portal Layout Styles Removal","hash":"portal-layout-styles-removal","id":4},{"text":"Portal Integration Angular Removal","hash":"portal-integration-angular","id":5},{"text":"Update required packages","hash":"update-packages","id":6},{"text":"Update application styles","hash":"styles-update","id":7},{"text":"Expose styles.css on top level","hash":"expose-styles-on-top-level","id":8},{"text":"Replace PortalCoreModule","hash":"replace-portal-core-module","id":9},{"text":"Check deleted components","hash":"deleted-components","id":10},{"text":"Removed from @onecx/angular-accelerator","hash":"removed-from-angular-accelerator","id":11},{"text":"Removed from @onecx/angular-integration-interface","hash":"removed-from-angular-integration-interface","id":12},{"text":"Removed from @onecx/angular-remote-components","hash":"removed-from-angular-remote-components","id":13},{"text":"Removed from @onecx/portal-integration-angular","hash":"removed-from-integration-angular","id":14},{"text":"Removed from @onecx/ngrx-accelerator","hash":"removed-from-ngrx-accelerator","id":15},{"text":"Removed from @onecx/shell-core","hash":"removed-from-shell-core","id":16},{"text":"Adjust Standalone Mode","hash":"standalone-mode","id":17},{"text":"FilterType values changes","hash":"filter-type","id":18},{"text":"Check usage of ConfigurationService","hash":"configuration-service","id":19},{"text":"ThemeService removed functionality","hash":"theme-service","id":20},{"text":"BASE_URL injection token","hash":"base-url","id":21},{"text":"Adjust angular packages in webpack","hash":"angular-in-webpack","id":22},{"text":"Move translation providers to bootstrap.ts for Remote Components","hash":"translation-bootstrap","id":23},{"text":"Remove addInitializeModuleGuard()","hash":"removed-add-initialize-guard","id":24},{"text":"PrimeNG related changes","hash":"primeng-related-changes","id":25},{"text":"Add required plugin to webpack config (will be changed to OneCX plugin)","hash":"primeng-new-plugin","id":26},{"text":"Provide ThemeConfig","hash":"theme-config","id":27},{"text":"Provide theme overrides","hash":"theme-overrides","id":28},{"text":"Angular Material related changes","hash":"material-related-changes","id":29},{"text":"Add required plugin to webpack config (will be changed to OneCX plugin)","hash":"material-new-plugin","id":30},{"text":"Further considerations","hash":"further-considerations","id":31},{"text":"Angular 19 changes","hash":"angular-19-further-changes","id":32},{"text":"PrimeNG 19 changes","hash":"primeng-19-further-changes","id":33}]},"129":{"id":129,"text":"This document aims to showcase how to manage dialogs using OneCX libraries. To properly use PortalDialogService, please import it via the providePortalDialogService in your remote module definition. Provide PortalDialogService via the providers array import { providePortalDialogService } from '@onecx/portal-integration-angular'; ... providers: [ providePortalDialogService(), ] ... Please, make sure that providePortalDialogService is used in in the remote module’s providers array or in remote component’s providers array (in case of standalone components usage). That way it will be accessible for all feature modules of the application. Inject PortalDialogService via constructor import { PortalDialogService } from '@onecx/portal-integration-angular'; export class MyClass() { constructor() { private portalDialogService: PortalDialogService } } To open the dialog use the openDialog method of the PortalDialogService. It returns an Observable, so make sure that the call is subscribed to. Please, make sure to unsubscribe in case of directly subscribing for an openDialog call. Table 1. openDialog method arguments Property name Type Description title TranslationKey | null Translation key for dialog title. componentOrMessage Type<any> | Type<DialogResult<T>> | Component<T> | TranslationKey | DialogMessage Either a component or a translation key of a message with optional parameters and icon to be displayed next to the message. primaryButtonTranslationKeyOrDetails TranslationKey | ButtonDialogButtonDetails Translation key with optional parameters and icon to be displayed next to the text of the button. secondaryButtonTranslationKeyOrDetails? TranslationKey | ButtonDialogButtonDetails Translation key with optional parameters and icon to be displayed next to the text of the button. extras? PortalDialogConfig Configuration object allowing for customization of the dialog behavior and visual aspects. Display dialog with message this.portalDialogService.openDialog('TITLE_KEY', 'MESSAGE_KEY', 'PRIMARY_BUTTON_KEY', 'SECONDARY_BUTTON_KEY').subscribe((stateOnClose) => { // operations when dialog has been closed }) Display dialog with component @Component({template: `<div>MyComponentTemplate</div>`}) class MyComponent {} this.portalDialogService.openDialog('TITLE_KEY', MyComponent, 'PRIMARY_BUTTON_KEY', 'SECONDARY_BUTTON_KEY').subscribe((stateOnClose) => { // operations when dialog has been closed }) Display dialog with component with inputs ⁣@Component({template: `<div>{{content | translate}}</div>`}) class MyComponent { @Input() content: string = '' } this.portalDialogService.openDialog('TITLE_KEY', { type: MyComponent, inputs: { content: 'CONTENT_KEY'}}, 'PRIMARY_BUTTON_KEY', 'SECONDARY_BUTTON_KEY').subscribe((stateOnClose) => { // operations when dialog has been closed }) If its desired to extend the result of the dialog, implement the DialogResult interface on the component displayed inside the dialog. DialogResult component example @Component({template: `<div> <input (change)=\"onInputChange($event)\"> </div>`}) export class MyComponent implements DialogResult<string> { dialogResult: string = '' onInputChange(event: any) { this.dialogResult = event.target.value } } portalDialogService.openDialog<string>('TITLE_KEY', { type: MyComponent }, 'PRIMARY_KEY', 'SECONDARY_KEY').subscribe((result: DialogState<string>) => { // result.value === MyComponent.dialogResult (during button click) // behavior when dialog closes }) If its desired to validate the dialog state prior to closing the dialog, implement the DialogButtonClicked interface on the component displayed inside the dialog. The ocxDialogButtonClicked method is called every time a primary, secondary or custom button was clicked. The method should return a boolean value (boolean, Observable<boolean>, Promise<boolean>) that determines if the dialog should be closed. The DialogState argument of ocxDialogButtonClicked method will contain information about the clicked button. Additionally, for components implementing DialogResult interface, it will also contain the dialog state captured on the button click event. Validate @Component({template: `<div> <input (change)=\"onInputChange($event)\"> </div>`}) class MyComponent implements DialogButtonClicked, DialogResult<string> { dialogResult: string = '' onInputChange(event: any) { this.dialogResult = event.target.value } ocxDialogButtonClicked(state: DialogState<unknown>) { if (state.button === 'primary') { // behavior on primary button click returning boolean value // close dialog if call was successful return this.service.post(state.result).pipe(map(response) => { return response !== undefined }) } else if (state.button === 'secondary') return false // don't close dialog on secondary button click return false } } portalDialogService.openDialog<string>('TITLE_KEY', { type: MyComponent }, 'PRIMARY_KEY', 'SECONDARY_KEY').subscribe(() => { // behavior when dialog closes }) If its desired to enable the dialog buttons based on the component’s state, implement the DialogPrimaryButtonDisabled, DialogSecondaryButtonDisabled or DialogCustomButtonsDisabled interface on the component displayed inside the dialog. When interface is implemented by the component, the respective buttons are disabled by default. DialogPrimaryButtonDisabled component example @Component({template: `<div>content</div>`}) export class MyComponent implements DialogPrimaryButtonDisabled { // emit true/false to enable/disable primary button @Output() primaryButtonEnabled: EventEmitter<boolean> = new EventEmitter() } portalDialogService.openDialog('TITLE_KEY', { type: MyComponent }, 'PRIMARY_KEY', 'SECONDARY_KEY').subscribe(() => { // behavior when dialog closes }) DialogSecondaryButtonDisabled component example @Component({template: `<div>content</div>`}) export class MyComponent implements DialogSecondaryButtonDisabled { // emit true/false to enable/disable secondary button @Output() secondaryButtonEnabled: EventEmitter<boolean> = new EventEmitter() } portalDialogService.openDialog('TITLE_KEY', { type: MyComponent }, 'PRIMARY_KEY', 'SECONDARY_KEY').subscribe(() => { // behavior when dialog closes }) DialogCustomButtonsDisabled component example @Component({template: `<div>content</div>`}) export class MyComponent implements DialogCustomButtonsDisabled { // emit true/false to enable/disable secondary button // id - id of the custom button to be enabled/disabled @Output() customButtonEnabled: EventEmitter<{ id: string; enabled: boolean; }>; } portalDialogService.openDialog('TITLE_KEY', { type: MyComponent }, 'PRIMARY_KEY', 'SECONDARY_KEY').subscribe(() => { // behavior when dialog closes }) If it is desired to customize the dialog in other areas then the presented content, it is recommended to use the openDialog method call argument called extras. Most of the configuration properties are compatible with the PrimeNg’s DynamicDialog config object, however there are some extended ones. To control the existence of the 'X' button (close button) for the dialog, use showXButton property. The 'X' button will be always visible if only one button is used for the dialog. To use buttons other than default ones, use customButtons property. It is an array of buttons to be added to the dialog. It is possible to control the alignment of the buttons. To control the autofocus of the dialog, use autoFocusButton and autoFocusButtonCustomId properties. When not provided, the autofocus will not be applied to any button. For the explanations of further properties, please refer to the PrimeNg’s DynamicDialog config object documentation.","title":"OneCX PortalDialogService","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"portal-dialog-service","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-portal-ui-libs/service/portal-dialog-service.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"overview","id":1},{"text":"Importing PortalDialogService","hash":"importing-portal-dialog-service","id":2},{"text":"Basic Usage","hash":"basic-usage","id":3},{"text":"Advanced Usage","hash":"advanced-usage","id":4},{"text":"Control Dialog Result","hash":"control-dialog-result","id":5},{"text":"Control Dialog Button Click Events","hash":"control-dialog-button-click-events","id":6},{"text":"Control Dialog Button Enablement","hash":"control-dialog-button-enablement","id":7},{"text":"Customize Dialog","hash":"customize-dialog","id":8},{"text":"Control The Dialog Close Button","hash":"close-button","id":9},{"text":"Add Custom Buttons to The Dialog","hash":"custom-buttons","id":10},{"text":"Control Buttons Autofocus","hash":"buttons-autofocus","id":11},{"text":"Further Customizations","hash":"further-customizations","id":12}]},"130":{"id":130,"text":"This service provides a convenient way to display translated toast messages in an Angular application.

It covers prerequisites, installation steps and initial configuration required to get onecx-local-env up and running on your local machine. Once setup is done the environment can be started, see Getting Started. onecx-local-env fully supports Linux, MacOS and Windows 10/11 via WSL2. Linux and MacOS are natively supported operating systems for onecx-local-env and do not require any operating-system-specific adjustments. Users of these operating systems can safely proceed to the next section of this guide. To run onecx-local-env on Windows, Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2 (WSL2) must be installed and configured on the system. To verify if WSL2 is currently installed, users can open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run the following command: wsl -l -v This command lists all installed WSL distributions along with their version numbers. To run onecx-local-env, at least one distribution must be installed and its version must be 2. In case of errors, no output, or no WSL2 distributions listed, WSL2 is either not installed or not properly configured. Official guidance on installing and configuring WSL2 can be found here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install Checkpoint At this point, users should have verified that their operating system is supported and, if using Windows, that WSL2 is properly installed and configured. If you are using Windows and WSL, you should install and use your entire development environment in WSL. This includes cloning Git repositories and installing tools like Docker, Git, and jq. Development environments like Visual Studio Code also need to be connected to WSL, and their extensions/plugins installed in WSL. Avoid any access to your files from Windows, i.e., via mount paths like /mnt/c/…​ onecx-local-env requires both Docker and Docker Compose to be installed directly on the operating system for Linux and MacOS users, or inside WSL2 for Windows users. The functionality of onecx-local-env has been tested with the following versions: Docker version 28.1.1 Docker Compose version v2.35.1 To ensure that all used features work correctly, it is recommended to use Docker Compose version v2.20.0 or higher. If any other versions are used, some features may not work as expected. In case of issues that aren’t clearly related to the local environment itself, a version upgrade of Docker and/or Docker Compose should be considered as a troubleshooting step. Checkpoint By now, a supported version of Docker and Docker Compose should be installed on the user’s system. To verify: Run docker --version to check the installed Docker version. Run docker compose version to check the installed Docker Compose version. To clone the onecx-local-env repository and proceed with the installation instructions, Git must be installed on the local machine or inside WSL2 for Windows users. To working on local microfrontends and import OneCX data, node.js must be installed inside WSL2. To import OneCX data, jq must be installed inside WSL2. Before starting the installation, the onecx-local-env repository needs to be cloned into a folder on the local machine/inside WSL2. This can be done using the following command: git clone https://github.com/onecx/onecx-local-env.git After cloning the repository, it is important to ensure that all provided shell scripts are executable. This includes the main lifecycle scripts located in the root directory, as well as any scripts located in the onecx-data and versions/* directories. To verify that the scripts are executable, the command ls -l can be run in the respective directories. Executable scripts will have an x in their permission string, for example: - e.g. -rwxr-xr-x import-onecx.sh If any of the scripts are not executable, the following command can be used to add execute permissions: chmod +x <file name> Checkpoint At this point, the onecx-local-env repository should be cloned and all necessary scripts should have execute permissions. To verify: Run ls -l in the root, onecx-data, and versions/* directories. Confirm all .sh scripts have execute permissions (indicated by an x in the permission string). If any scripts are missing execute permissions, run chmod +x <file name>. In order to expose multiple services on the same local port, OneCX Local Environment uses the Traefik reverse proxy. Traefik will be available via the host’s port 80, and route requests to the appropriate services based on the requested hostname. To ensure that all relevant hostnames are correctly routed to the local machine and resolved by the Traefik proxy, the system hosts file needs to be modified to include entries for all OneCX services. Windows: c:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts Linux: /etc/hosts macOS: /etc/hosts After identifying the relevant file location, the hosts file can be edited using any text editor of choice. It is important to note that editing the hosts file will require administrator privileges on most systems. It’s therefore important to edit the file with elevated permissions (e.g. by running sudo nano /etc/hosts on Linux/MacOS or opening Notepad as Administrator on Windows). The following entries need to be added to the end of the hosts file: Click here to view hosts entries # OneCX - base 127.0.0.1 traefik 127.0.0.1 postgresdb 127.0.0.1 pgadmin 127.0.0.1 keycloak-app 127.0.0.1 keycloak-app2 # OneCX - local services 127.0.0.1 local-proxy 127.0.0.1 sonar # OneCX - products 127.0.0.1 onecx-announcement-svc 127.0.0.1 onecx-announcement-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-announcement-ui 127.0.0.1 onecx-bookmark-svc 127.0.0.1 onecx-bookmark-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-document-svc 127.0.0.1 onecx-document-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-help-svc 127.0.0.1 onecx-help-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-iam-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-iam-svc 127.0.0.1 onecx-parameter-svc 127.0.0.1 onecx-parameter-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-permission-svc 127.0.0.1 onecx-permission-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-product-store-svc 127.0.0.1 onecx-product-store-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-search-config-svc 127.0.0.1 onecx-search-config-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-shell-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-tenant-svc 127.0.0.1 onecx-tenant-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-theme-svc 127.0.0.1 onecx-theme-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-welcome-svc 127.0.0.1 onecx-welcome-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-workspace-svc 127.0.0.1 onecx-workspace-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-user-profile-avatar-svc 127.0.0.1 onecx-user-profile-svc 127.0.0.1 onecx-user-profile-bff Windows users should ensure that the entries are automatically synced to WSL2 by following these steps: Restart WSL2 after modifying the Windows hosts file. Open the WSL2 terminal and run cat /etc/hosts to verify that the entries were added. If the entries are not present in the WSL2 hosts file, they need to be added manually by following the instructions for Linux/MacOS above. Checkpoint At this point, all necessary entries should be added to the system hosts file. To verify: Confirm the listed OneCX hostnames are added to your system hosts file. If using Windows with WSL2, restart WSL2 and check /etc/hosts inside WSL2 to ensure entries were synced from Windows. If entries are missing in WSL2, add them manually by following the Linux instructions above. After completing the steps outlined in this guide, onecx-local-env is now set up and ready to run a local OneCX environment. Instructions on how to start, access, and stop the local environment can be found in the Getting Started guide.","title":"Set up OneCX Local Environment","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"setup","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-local-env/setup.html","titles":[{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"Supported Operating Systems","hash":"supported-operating-systems","id":2},{"text":"Linux & MacOS","hash":"linux-macos","id":3},{"text":"Windows","hash":"windows","id":4},{"text":"Docker & Docker Compose","hash":"docker-docker-compose","id":5},{"text":"Git","hash":"git","id":6},{"text":"node.js","hash":"node-js","id":7},{"text":"jq","hash":"jq","id":8},{"text":"Installation Steps","hash":"installation-steps","id":9},{"text":"Cloning the repository","hash":"cloning-the-repository","id":10},{"text":"Ensuring script executability","hash":"ensuring-script-executability","id":11},{"text":"Modifying the hosts file","hash":"modifying-the-hosts-file","id":12},{"text":"Hosts file locations","hash":"hosts-file-locations","id":13},{"text":"Editing the hosts file","hash":"editing-the-hosts-file","id":14},{"text":"Next Step","hash":"next-step","id":15}]},"141":{"id":141,"text":"Keycloak is an open-source software for Identity and Access Management (IAM) that provides features like single sign-on (SSO), user authentication, and authorization for modern applications and services.

The remoteEntry.js should be loaded. Figure 1. Local running Microfrontend The integration can be easily accomplished through routing and path rewriting by Traefik. This is necessary because the Docker Compose project’s network for OneCX is isolated from the outside world. And the meaning of \"localhost\" within the OneCX network (Docker uses \"host.docker.internal\" internally) differs from \"localhost\" outside of it. Therefore, requests from the Docker environment must be routed to the outside world and mapped to the localhost address. This step is done with the script toggle-mfes.sh. It creates a configuration file with routing and path rewrite instructions that are read by Traefik. See also the documentation for toggle-mfes.sh.

If the keycloak-app service is reported as unhealthy, please try to re-run the docker compose command to start the service again. In some cases, Keycloak might take a bit longer to start up, and re-running the command can help resolve the issue. This issue is more common in OneCX Local Environment v1 due to differences in the performed health checks. In some cases, specifically when services don’t have explicit dependencies defined via the depends_on directive, Docker Compose might not wait for all health checks to pass before finalizing the startup process. If you want to force Docker Compose to wait for all health checks to pass, you can use the --wait flag when starting the services. Example: docker compose up -d --wait Some onecx-local-env services might take longer than others to start up and become fully operational. This can cause issues if you or a script you are running tries to access a service before it is ready. To prevent any issues it is recommended to wait for at least 30 seconds after all services are reported as healthy before accessing any service or running any import scripts. The import script for OneCX Local Environment v2 has a built-in wait time of 30 seconds after all services are healthy to account for this. If you are using OneCX Local Environment v1, please ensure to manually wait for at least 30 seconds after all services are healthy before running the import script.

To add new files to the imports directory, follow these guidelines: Naming Conventions - use consistent naming patterns based on the type of data being imported. The patterns are listed in the Convention and file list section. File Structure - JSON files should adhere to the existing structure that is compliant with the respective service’s API. Script Updates - If adding a new type of data, add new import script that includes new files and uses the appropriate service. Make sure to define the structure of the JSON files. Testing - Test the import process by running the relevant script and verifying the data in the environment. By adhering to these conventions, you can ensure consistency and maintainability in the OneCX Local Environment.","title":"OneCX Data","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"data","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-local-env/internal/data.html","titles":[{"text":"Folder Structure","hash":"folder-structure","id":1},{"text":"Convention and file list","hash":"convention-and-file-list","id":2},{"text":"Assignments","hash":"assignments","id":3},{"text":"Parameters","hash":"parameters","id":4},{"text":"Permissions","hash":"permissions","id":5},{"text":"Product Store","hash":"product-store","id":6},{"text":"Microfrontends","hash":"microfrontends","id":7},{"text":"Microservices","hash":"microservices","id":8},{"text":"Products","hash":"products","id":9},{"text":"Slots","hash":"slots","id":10},{"text":"Tenant","hash":"tenant","id":11},{"text":"Theme","hash":"theme","id":12},{"text":"Workspace","hash":"workspace","id":13},{"text":"Adding New Files","hash":"adding-new-files","id":14}]},"149":{"id":149,"text":"This document explains how networking is configured and managed in the OneCX local development environment.

Traefik then forwards requests from the Docker network to the external local microfrontend. The script can be run from the root directory of the onecx-local-env repository. The Traefik configuration files are stored in init-data/traefik/active/. Traefik immediately detects any changes there. Here is the command to list the currently integrated microfrontends: ./toggle-mfes.sh -l Figure 1.

Successful deintegration The Traefik configurations are being cleaned up: All specific configuration files for the Microfrontend integration are being deleted. ./toggle-mfes.sh -c Figure 6. Reset all Microfrontend configurations in Traefik There is no need to deintegrate a microfrontend after use. Simply stopping the local microfrontend is sufficient. Traefik will then automatically route requests to the corresponding microfrontend in Docker Compose. As described earlier, Traefik is responsible for routing. Each route is assigned a priority, which Traefik derives by default from the length of the rule: the longer the rule, the higher the priority. To avoid routing collisions, the local microfrontends are configured with a significantly higher priority. This means you can run multiple microfrontends with the same routing rule in parallel and still control which microfrontend is used in OneCX. This is very useful if you want to use locally running microfrontends without having to stop the corresponding service in Docker Compose. The Traefik configuration generated when integrating a microfrontend (see above) sets a significantly higher priority for this route, so that the local microfrontend is used preferentially. In this example, the OneCX Workspace microfrontend is running both in Docker Compose (Service: onecx-workspace-ui) and locally (Service: local_workspace). The local instance is used preferentially because it has a higher priority (323) than the Docker Compose instance (52). Figure 7.

Please make sure to also read the top-level getting started guide for general information and instructions that apply to all versions. v1 was the initial version of the local development environment for OneCX. While it still works and will be maintained for some time to avoid breaking existing workflows, some significant quality-of-life improvements were implemented in OneCX Local Environment v2. We therefore encourage new users to start with OneCX Local Environment v2. To migrate from v1 to v2, please refer to the Migrate to v2 guide. v1 contains services for Traefik, Postgres, Keycloak and all currently existing OneCX products (SVC, BFF, UI). Some of these services are started by default, while others can only be started via specific profiles. For more details on the available services, profiles, environment variables, networks and volumes, please refer to the Components section of this document. To start a minimal local development environment (Traefik, Postgres and Keycloak) together with OneCX Shell, OneCX Workspace and their dependencies, run one of the following commands: From the repository root: docker compose -f versions/v1/docker-compose.v1.yaml up -d From the versions/v1 directory: docker compose up -d To additionally start the OneCX Parameter product, use the --profile parameter flag: From the repository root: docker compose -f versions/v1/docker-compose.v1.yaml --profile parameter up -d From the versions/v1 directory: docker compose --profile parameter up -d To start all services defined in the compose file, use the --profile all flag: From the repository root: docker compose -f versions/v1/docker-compose.v1.yaml --profile all up -d From the versions/v1 directory: docker compose --profile all up -d To stop the started services, run one of the following commands: From the repository root: docker compose -f versions/v1/docker-compose.v1.yaml down Stop specific profile from the repository root: docker compose -f versions/v1/docker-compose.v1.yaml --profile <profile-name> down From the versions/v1 directory: docker compose down Stop specific profile from the versions/v1 directory: docker compose --profile <profile-name> down When starting OneCX Local Environment v1 for the first time, some initial data has to be imported to set up the environment correctly. To import the initial data, please follow these steps: Start the environment using the all profile (see [running-onecx-local-env-v1]). Wait for all services to be healthy. Wait for at least 30 seconds to ensure that all services are fully initialized and operational. Run the import script: From the repository root: ./versions/v1/import-onecx.v1.sh Ensure that status messages for each step are green and indicate success. If any step of the import fails, please verify that all services required for the import (Traefik, Postgres, Keycloak and all OneCX SVCs) are running and healthy. If they are, please check the logs of the service that failed the import for potential issues. To do so run docker ps to get the container ID and docker logs <container-id> to view the logs. If they are not, please start the missing services and wait until they are healthy before re-running the import script.

It will be updated in the near future. This guide highlights the key differences between OneCX Local Environment v1 and v2, and explains how you can adapt your setup to ensure that it seamlessly works with v2. In v1, the network that all services connected to was named example. In v2, this network is now named default. If you have any custom services that need to attach to the same network as OneCX, make sure they connect to default from now on. In v1: Some core services started automatically when running: docker compose up -d Additional services could be started using the two existing profiles: all and parameters. This approach gave developers very little control over which apps were started, making it hard to, for example, run only a small subset of apps and one OneCX product. In v2: The system is fully profile-based. Nothing starts by default when you run: docker compose up -d You must explicitly specify at least one profile, for example: docker compose --profile base up -d Profiles allow fine-grained control over which services run. For details on available profiles, see the v2 documentation. In v1: The data import script had the sole purpose of sending data to services to trigger the import. This caused issues if containers were not running, unhealthy, or still starting up. In v2: The import script now: Starts all required services. Waits for them to become healthy and operational. Imports the data. Spins down the started services afterward. This improves reliability for most developers. However, if you use the script inside another script that needs containers to remain running after import, you can disable container management by running the script using: SKIP_CONTAINER_MANAGEMENT=true ./import-onecx.sh This ensures the script does not start or stop any containers, allowing you to manage them manually. Please be aware that in this mode, it’s your responsibility to ensure that all required containers (Traefik, Postgres, Keycloak and all OneCX SVCs) are running and healthy before executing the script. Before the creation of v2, all environment variable files were located in the root directory of the project. To allow for better organization and scoped environment variables per version, all environment variable files are now located in the directory of the version they belong to (e.g., ./versions/v2/ for v2). As of right now, ./versions/v1/ and ./versions/v2/ contain identical .env, bff.env and svc.env files, but this may change in the future (e.g. if different image tags have to be used for different versions). If you or any of your scripts reference these files, please update the paths accordingly. Checkpoint After reading all sections of this document you should be able to make all necessary adjustments to migrate from v1 to v2 of the OneCX Local Environment. To recap, the main necessary adjustments are: Change any custom services that connect to the example network to connect to the default network instead. Change any scripts or commands that start services to use profiles instead of relying on default behavior. Adjust import scripts if you need to manage container states manually. Update paths to any .env, bff.env or svc.env files to point to the new locations in the respective version directory.","title":"Migrate to v2 Edition","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"migrate","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-local-env/versions/v2/migrate.html","titles":[{"text":"Network Rename","hash":"_network_rename","id":1},{"text":"Service Startup Behavior","hash":"_service_startup_behavior","id":2},{"text":"Data Import Script Improvements","hash":"_data_import_script_improvements","id":3},{"text":"Moved ENV Files","hash":"_moved_env_files","id":4}]},"159":{"id":159,"text":"Disclaimer This page was created for an older version of OneCX Local Environment and may not reflect the current state of the project. It will be updated in the near future. This document only contains information specific to v2 of the OneCX Local Environment. Please make sure to also read the Getting started guide for general information and instructions that apply to all versions. v2 is the current latest version of the local development environment for OneCX. If you are currently using OneCX Local Environment v1 and want to migrate to v2, please refer to the Migrate to v2 guide for detailed migration instructions. v2 contains services for Traefik, Postgres, Keycloak and all currently existing OneCX products (SVC, BFF, UI). To ensure memory-efficiency and allow developers to only start the services they need, all services are grouped into profiles that can be started individually. No services are started by default and at least one profile must be specified when starting the environment. For more details on the available services, profiles, environment variables, networks and volumes, please refer to the Components section of this document. Since the root compose file of onecx-local-env always points to the current latest version of the OneCX Local Environment, developers can run commands against v2 without needing to specify the versioned compose file explicitly. To start a minimal local development environment (Traefik, Postgres and Keycloak) together with the most commonly used OneCX products (Shell, Workspace, Theme, Permission, Product Store, User Profile and Welcome) and their dependencies, developers can use the base profile. This profile is recommended for most users and should be viewed as the default. To start the environment with the base profile, run the following command: From the repository root: docker compose --profile base up -d To give developers more flexibility and full control over which services/products to start, several additional profiles are available. Please refer to the Profiles section of this document for a list of all available profiles. To stop a started profile, run the following command, replacing <profile-name> with the name of the profile to stop (e.g. base): From the repository root: docker compose --profile <profile-name> down Since the root import script of onecx-local-env always points to the current latest version of the OneCX Local Environment, developers can execute the root import script to import initial data into their v2 environment without needing to specify the versioned import script explicitly. When starting OneCX Local Environment v2 for the first time, some initial data has to be imported to set up the environment correctly. To import the initial data, please follow these steps: Run the automated import script: From the repository root: ./import-onecx.sh Wait for the script to finish and ensure that status messages for each step are green and indicate success. If you encounter any issues while running the import script, please first try to increase the timeout defined in line 27 of the versions/v2/import-onecx.v2.sh script (default: 30 seconds) and re-run the script. If the issue persists, do the following: Manually start the data-import profile to start only the services required for the import of initial data (Traefik, Postgres, Keycloak and all OneCX product SVCs): docker compose --profile data-import up -d Wait for all services to be healthy. Wait for at least 30 seconds to ensure that all services are fully initialized and operational Run the import script while skipping container management: SKIP_CONTAINER_MANAGEMENT=true ./versions/v2/import-onecx.v2.sh If any step of the import fails, please verify that all services required for the import (Traefik, Postgres, Keycloak and all OneCX SVCs) are running and healthy. If they are, please check the logs of the service that failed the import for potential issues. To do so run docker ps to get the container ID and docker logs <container-id> to view the logs. If they are not, please start the missing services and wait until they are healthy before re-running the import script. Stop the data-import profile after the import has completed successfully: docker compose --profile data-import down After the script has completed successfully, all initial data has been imported and the environment is ready to use. If you want to integrate the import script into your own scripts and want to only perform the actual import operations instead of also starting and stopping all necessary services, you can set the SKIP_CONTAINER_MANAGEMENT environment variable to 1 or true before executing the script: From the repository root: SKIP_CONTAINER_MANAGEMENT=true ./import-onecx.sh traefik postgresdb pgadmin keycloak-app OneCX Product Services: Shell: onecx-shell-ui, onecx-shell-bff Theme: onecx-theme-svc, onecx-theme-bff, onecx-theme-ui Workspace: onecx-workspace-svc, onecx-workspace-bff, onecx-workspace-ui Permission: onecx-permission-svc, onecx-permission-bff, onecx-permission-ui Product Store: onecx-product-store-svc, onecx-product-store-bff, onecx-product-store-ui User Profile: onecx-user-profile-svc, onecx-user-profile-bff, onecx-user-profile-ui IAM: onecx-iam-kc-svc, onecx-iam-bff, onecx-iam-ui Tenant: onecx-tenant-svc, onecx-tenant-bff, onecx-tenant-ui Welcome: onecx-welcome-svc, onecx-welcome-bff, onecx-welcome-ui Help: onecx-help-svc, onecx-help-bff, onecx-help-ui Parameter: onecx-parameter-svc, onecx-parameter-bff, onecx-parameter-ui To give developers more flexibility and ensure the highest possible memory-efficiency, OneCX Local Environment v2 exposes all services via a variety of profiles that can be started individually. At least one profile must be specified when starting the environment. The following profiles are available: minimal starts only a minimal local development environment (Traefik, Postgres and Keycloak) together with OneCX Shell and its dependencies useful as a basis if developers only want to test one or very few applications/products inside the Shell keeps memory usage as low as possible data-import not recommended for regular use is used internally by import-onecx.v2.sh to start only the services required for the import of initial data (Traefik, Postgres, Keycloak and all OneCX product SVCs) base the recommended default profile for most users starts a minimal local development environment (Traefik, Postgres and Keycloak) together with the most commonly used OneCX products (Shell, Workspace, Theme, Permission, Product Store, User Profile and Welcome) and their dependencies pgadmin starts PGAdmin alongside Traefik and Postgres (if not already started via another profile) useful if developers want to use PGAdmin to inspect or manage the Postgres database all starts all available services might be useful in certain testing scenarios, but is generally not recommended due to high memory usage <PRODUCT-NAME> starts all services for a specific OneCX product (SVC, BFF, UI) must be combined with at least the minimal profile to also start the required dependencies (Traefik, Postgres, Keycloak and Shell) e.g. to start only the Workspace product alongside its dependencies, run: docker compose --profile minimal --profile workspace up -d <PRODUCT-NAME>-ui starts only the UI stack of a specific OneCX product (UI, BFF) only works if all dependencies (e.g. minimal profile and related product SVC) are already started useful if developers need to constantly run a certain product SVC (e.g. Workspace) and want to occasionally start and stop the related UI stack e.g. to start only the Workspace UI alongside an already running Workspace SVC, run: docker compose --profile workspace-ui up -d For details on how to run profiles, please refer to the [running-onecx-local-env-v2] section of this document.

All OneCX Announcement Management issues are tracked and maintained at the issue tracking tool. OneCX Announcement Management Software is a comprehensive solution for managing Announcement items in a user-friendly and efficient manner. It is a solution that consists of three main components: a backend service, a user interface and a backend-for-frontend (BFF) layer. The three components of OneCX Announcement Management Software are as follows: Announcement Management User Interface (UI) The user interface component is based on Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications. It offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface for interacting with the Announcement management system. Users can perform actions such as searching and editing of Announcement items. Announcement Management Backend for Frontend (BFF) The BFF layer acts as an intermediary between the frontend user interface and the backend service. It handles tasks such as data aggregation, transformation, and composition to provide an optimized API for the UI. The BFF layer is designed to enhance performance and simplify the integration of the frontend with the backend service. Announcement Management Backend Service (SVC) This component provides the core functionality. It handles tasks such as storage, retrieval and editing of Announcement items. The backend is built cloud native using Quarkus. Interfaces are based on the TM-Forum standard TMF 667.

Announcement Management refers to the systematic process of capturing, organizing, storing, and retrieving Announcement items. OneCX Announcement is a comprehensive solution for managing Announcement items for OneCX products in a user-friendly and efficient manner Announcements contain important news for an organization or user group. They can be shown on the landing page and on a banner at the top of any page. Their visibility may be adjusted, so that individual items can be seen only in relevant workspaces or products. In this document we are only referring to the OneCX Announcement User Interface (UI) of OneCX Announcement Management. The user interface (UI) for this Announcement Management component is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for managing Announcement items in the cloud-native environment built with Quarkus. To start developing the OneCX Announcement User Interface, you need to set up your local development environment. It’s recommended that you use WSL as the runtime for your application, as shown in the figure below. If you are using a different runtime, please check that you meet the requirements below. Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 Maven build tool Git Docker + Docker Compose Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - recommended NodeJS Start by cloning the required repositories to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/onecx/onecx-announcement-ui.git git clone https://github.com/onecx/announcement-dev.git The repository onecx-announcement contains the source code of the OneCX Announcement product. The repository onecx-announcement-ui contains the source code of the OneCX Announcement user interface as part of the product. Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses, making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port, we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames. It is recommended that the WSL host file and the Windows host file are aligned. Unless you have disabled this behaviour, the WSL host file will be automatically generated from the Windows host file when WSL is restarted. Open the file C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts in your favorite editor and add the following entries: 127.0.0.1 postgresdb 127.0.0.1 keycloak-app 127.0.0.1 traefik 127.0.0.1 onecx-announcement-ui 127.0.0.1 onecx-announcement-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-announcement-svc If needed, update the file \\etc\\hosts in your favorite Linux editor and add the same entries like above. In a local development environment, Docker Compose is used to define and manage multiple containers as a single application stack. It enables developers to easily start, stop, and configure all the necessary services and dependencies required by OneCX Announcement Management using a simple configuration file. mkdir onecx-announcement cd onecx-announcement docker compose up -d traefik postgresdb pgadmin keycloak-app traefik: Traefik is an ingress controller for Kubernetes deployments that enables dynamic traffic routing and load balancing based on defined rules and configurations. postgresdb: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system.

If you would like to contribute to the development of OneCX Bookmark Management Software, please follow our contribution guidelines (tbd). Bookmark management refers to storing and retrieving bookmarks. Bookmark Storage and Retrieval: Store and retrieve Bookmarks usable in context of OneCX applications. All OneCX Bookmark Management issues are tracked and maintained at the issue tracking tool. OneCX Bookmark Management Software is a comprehensive solution for managing Bookmarks in a user-friendly and efficient manner. It is a solution that consists of three main components: a backend service, a user interface and a backend-for-frontend (BFF) layer. The three components of OneCX Bookmark Management Software are as follows: Bookmark Management User Interface (UI) The user interface component is based on Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications. It offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface for interacting with the Bookmark management system. Users can perform actions such as searching and editing of Bookmarks. Bookmark Management Backend for Frontend (BFF) The BFF layer acts as an intermediary between the frontend user interface and the backend service. It handles tasks such as data aggregation, transformation, and composition to provide an optimized API for the UI. The BFF layer is designed to enhance performance and simplify the integration of the frontend with the backend service. Bookmark Management Backend Service (SVC) This component provides the core functionality. It handles tasks such as storage, retrieval and editing of Bookmarks. The backend is built cloud native using Quarkus. Interfaces are based on the TM-Forum standard TMF 667. To get started with OneCX Bookmark Management Software, please refer to the following installation and setup instructions specific to each component: OneCX Bookmark Management UI (User Interface) - Getting Started OneCX Bookmark Management BFF (Backend for Frontend) - Getting Started OneCX Bookmark Management SVC (Backend) - Getting Started For detailed usage instructions and API documentation, please refer to the respective documentation files for each component. tbd","title":"OneCX Bookmark

OneCX Bookmark is a comprehensive solution for managing bookmark items for OneCX products in a user-friendly and efficient manner. In this document we are only referring to the OneCX Bookmark User Interface (UI) of OneCX Bookmark Management. The user interface (UI) for this bookmark management component is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for managing bookmark items in the cloud-native environment built with Quarkus. To start developing the OneCX Bookmark User Interface, you need to set up your local development environment. It’s recommended that you use WSL as the runtime for your application, as shown in the figure below. If you are using a different runtime, please check that you meet the requirements below. Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 Maven build tool Git Docker + Docker Compose Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - recommended NodeJS Start by cloning the required repositories to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/onecx/onecx-bookmark-ui.git The repository onecx-bookmark contains the source code of the OneCX Bookmark product. The repository onecx-bookmark-ui contains the source code of the OneCX Bookmark user interface as part of the product. Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses, making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port, we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames. It is recommended that the WSL host file and the Windows host file are aligned. Unless you have disabled this behaviour, the WSL host file will be automatically generated from the Windows host file when WSL is restarted. Open the file C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts in your favorite editor and add the following entries: 127.0.0.1 postgresdb 127.0.0.1 keycloak-app 127.0.0.1 traefik 127.0.0.1 onecx-bookmark-ui 127.0.0.1 onecx-bookmark-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-bookmark-svc If needed, update the file \\etc\\hosts in your favorite linux editor and add the same entries like above. In a local development environment, Docker Compose is used to define and manage multiple containers as a single application stack. It enables developers to easily start, stop, and configure all the necessary services and dependencies required by OneCX Bookmark Management using a simple configuration file. mkdir onecx-bookmark cd onecx-bookmark docker compose up -d traefik postgresdb pgadmin keycloak-app traefik: Traefik is an ingress controller for Kubernetes deployments that enables dynamic traffic routing and load balancing based on defined rules and configurations. postgresdb: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system. It is used as persistence layer for storing and managing data of OneCX products, providing reliability and scalability. pgadmin: pgAdmin is an open-source administration and development platform that offers a user-friendly graphical interface for managing and interacting with the local PostgreSQL database. This is optional. keycloak: Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management system that simplifies authentication, authorization, and single sign-on for web and mobile applications.","title":"","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"index","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-bookmark-ui/index.html","titles":[{"text":"onecx-bookmark-ui","hash":"_onecx_bookmark_ui","id":1},{"text":"OneCX Bookmark UI","hash":"_onecx_bookmark_ui_2","id":2},{"text":"What is Bookmark Management","hash":"_what_is_bookmark_management","id":3},{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":4},{"text":"Getting Started","hash":"_getting_started","id":5},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":6},{"text":"Clone the Repository","hash":"_clone_the_repository","id":7},{"text":"Update local DNS resolution","hash":"_update_local_dns_resolution","id":8},{"text":"Update Windows host file","hash":"_update_windows_host_file","id":9},{"text":"Update WSL host file","hash":"_update_wsl_host_file","id":10},{"text":"Starting OneCX dependencies","hash":"_starting_onecx_dependencies","id":11}]},"184":{"id":184,"text":"OneCX Bookmark Management refers to the systematic process of capturing, organizing, storing, and retrieving bookmark items.

OneCX Announcement is a comprehensive solution for managing Announcement items for OneCX products in a user-friendly and efficient manner Announcements contain important news for an organization or user group. They can be shown on the landing page and on a banner at the top of any page. Their visibility may be adjusted, so that individual items can be seen only in relevant workspaces or products. In this document we are only referring to the OneCX Announcement User Interface (UI) of OneCX Announcement Management. The user interface (UI) for this Announcement Management component is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for managing Announcement items in the cloud-native environment built with Quarkus. To start developing the OneCX Announcement User Interface, you need to set up your local development environment. It’s recommended that you use WSL as the runtime for your application, as shown in the figure below. If you are using a different runtime, please check that you meet the requirements below. Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 Maven build tool Git Docker + Docker Compose Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - recommended NodeJS Start by cloning the required repositories to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/onecx/onecx-announcement-ui.git git clone https://github.com/onecx/announcement-dev.git The repository onecx-announcement contains the source code of the OneCX Announcement product. The repository onecx-announcement-ui contains the source code of the OneCX Announcement user interface as part of the product. Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses, making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port, we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames. It is recommended that the WSL host file and the Windows host file are aligned. Unless you have disabled this behaviour, the WSL host file will be automatically generated from the Windows host file when WSL is restarted. Open the file C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts in your favorite editor and add the following entries: 127.0.0.1 postgresdb 127.0.0.1 keycloak-app 127.0.0.1 traefik 127.0.0.1 onecx-announcement-ui 127.0.0.1 onecx-announcement-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-announcement-svc If needed, update the file \\etc\\hosts in your favorite Linux editor and add the same entries like above. In a local development environment, Docker Compose is used to define and manage multiple containers as a single application stack. It enables developers to easily start, stop, and configure all the necessary services and dependencies required by OneCX Announcement Management using a simple configuration file. mkdir onecx-announcement cd onecx-announcement docker compose up -d traefik postgresdb pgadmin keycloak-app traefik: Traefik is an ingress controller for Kubernetes deployments that enables dynamic traffic routing and load balancing based on defined rules and configurations. postgresdb: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system.

If you would like to contribute to the development of OneCX Help Management Software, please follow our contribution guidelines (tbd). All OneCX Help issues are tracked and maintained at the issue tracking tool. OneCX Help Software is a comprehensive solution for managing Help items in a user-friendly and efficient manner. It is a solution that consists of three main components: a backend service, a user interface and a backend-for-frontend (BFF) layer. The three components of the OneCX Help Software are as follows: Help User Interface (UI) The user interface component is based on Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications. It offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface for interacting with the Help system. Users can perform actions such as searching and editing of Help items. Help Backend for Frontend (BFF) The BFF layer acts as an intermediary between the frontend user interface and the backend service. It handles tasks such as data aggregation, transformation, and composition to provide an optimized API for the UI. The BFF layer is designed to enhance performance and simplify the integration of the frontend with the backend service. Help Backend Service (SVC) This component provides the core functionality. It handles tasks such as storage, retrieval and editing of Help items. The backend is built cloud native using Quarkus. Interfaces are based on the TM-Forum standard TMF 667. To get started with OneCX Help Software, please refer to the following installation and setup instructions specific to each component: OneCX Help UI (User Interface) - Getting Started OneCX Help BFF (Backend for Frontend) - Getting Started OneCX Help SVC (Backend) - Getting Started For detailed usage instructions and API documentation, please refer to the respective documentation files for each component. tbd","title":"OneCX Help

Help Management refers to the systematic process of capturing, organizing, storing, and retrieving help items. OneCX Help is a comprehensive solution for managing Help items for OneCX products in a user-friendly and efficient manner. In this document we are only referring to the OneCX Help User Interface (UI) of OneCX Help Management. The UI for this Help management component is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for managing Help items in the cloud-native environment built with Quarkus. To start developing the OneCX Help UI, you need to set up your local development environment. It’s recommended that you use WSL as the runtime for your application, as shown in the figure below. If you are using a different runtime, please check that you meet the requirements below. Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 Maven build tool Git Docker + Docker Compose Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - recommended NodeJS Start by cloning the required repositories to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/onecx/onecx-help-ui.git git clone https://github.com/onecx/help-dev.git The repository onecx-help contains the source code of the OneCX Help product. The repository onecx-help-ui contains the source code of the OneCX Help UI as part of the product. Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses, making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port, we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames.

OneCX Help is a comprehensive solution for managing Help items for OneCX products in a user-friendly and efficient manner. In this document we are only referring to the OneCX Help User Interface (UI) of OneCX Help Management. The UI for this Help management component is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for managing Help items in the cloud-native environment built with Quarkus. To start developing the OneCX Help UI, you need to set up your local development environment. It’s recommended that you use WSL as the runtime for your application, as shown in the figure below. If you are using a different runtime, please check that you meet the requirements below. Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 Maven build tool Git Docker + Docker Compose Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - recommended NodeJS Start by cloning the required repositories to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/onecx/onecx-help-ui.git git clone https://github.com/onecx/help-dev.git The repository onecx-help contains the source code of the OneCX Help product. The repository onecx-help-ui contains the source code of the OneCX Help UI as part of the product. Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses, making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port, we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames. It is recommended that the WSL host file and the Windows host file are aligned. Unless you have disabled this behaviour, the WSL host file will be automatically generated from the Windows host file when WSL is restarted. Open the file C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts in your favorite editor and add the following entries: 127.0.0.1 postgresdb 127.0.0.1 keycloak-app 127.0.0.1 traefik 127.0.0.1 onecx-help-ui 127.0.0.1 onecx-help-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-help-svc If needed, update the file \\etc\\hosts in your favorite linux editor and add the same entries like above.

You may obtain a copy of the license in the corresponding LICENSE file or visit the Apache website for more information. We welcome contributions from the community. If you would like to contribute to the development of OneCX Identity Access Management Software, please follow our contribution guidelines (tbd). Identity Access Management (IAM) refers to storing and retrieving user identity items usable in context of OneCX applications. User Identity item Storage and Retrieval: Store and retrieve user identity items usable in context of OneCX applications. All OneCX IAM issues are tracked and maintained at the issue tracking tool. OneCX IAM Software is a comprehensive solution for managing user identity items in a user-friendly and efficient manner. It is a solution that consists of three main components: a backend service, a user interface and a backend-for-frontend (BFF) layer. The three components of the OneCX IAM Software are as follows: IAM User Interface (UI) The user interface component is based on Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications. It offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface for interacting with the IAM system. Users can perform actions such as searching and editing of user identity items. IAM Backend for Frontend (BFF) The BFF layer acts as an intermediary between the frontend user interface and the backend service. It handles tasks such as data aggregation, transformation, and composition to provide an optimized API for the UI. The BFF layer is designed to enhance performance and simplify the integration of the frontend with the backend service. IAM Backend Service (SVC) This component provides the core functionality. It handles tasks such as storage, retrieval and editing of user identity items. The backend is built cloud native using Quarkus. Interfaces are based on the TM-Forum standard TMF 667. To get started with OneCX IAM Software, please refer to the following installation and setup instructions specific to each component: OneCX IAM UI (User Interface) - Getting Started OneCX IAM BFF (Backend for Frontend) - Getting Started OneCX IAM SVC (Backend) - Getting Started For detailed usage instructions and API documentation, please refer to the respective documentation files for each component. tbd","title":"OneCX Identity Access

OneCX IAM is a comprehensive solution for managing Identity Access to OneCX products in a user-friendly and efficient manner. In this document we are only referring to the user interface (UI) of OneCX Identity Access Management. The UI for this IAM component is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for managing Identity Access in the cloud-native environment built with Quarkus. To start developing the OneCX IAM User Interface, you need to set up your local development environment. It’s recommended that you use WSL as the runtime for your application, as shown in the figure below. If you are using a different runtime, please check that you meet the requirements below. Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 Maven build tool Git Docker + Docker Compose Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - recommended NodeJS Start by cloning the required repositories to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/onecx/onecx-iam-ui.git git clone https://github.com/onecx/iam-dev.git The repository onecx-iam contains the source code of the OneCX IAM product. The repository onecx-iam-ui contains the source code of the OneCX IAM user interface as part of the product. Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses, making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port, we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames. It is recommended that the WSL host file and the Windows host file are aligned. Unless you have disabled this behaviour, the WSL host file will be automatically generated from the Windows host file when WSL is restarted. Open the file C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts in your favorite editor and add the following entries: 127.0.0.1 postgresdb 127.0.0.1 keycloak-app 127.0.0.1 traefik 127.0.0.1 onecx-iam-ui 127.0.0.1 onecx-iam-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-iam-svc If needed, update the file \\etc\\hosts in your favorite linux editor and add the same entries like above. In a local development environment, Docker Compose is used to define and manage multiple containers as a single application stack. It enables developers to easily start, stop, and configure all the necessary services and dependencies required by OneCX Identity Access Management using a simple configuration file. mkdir onecx-iam cd onecx-iam docker compose up -d traefik postgresdb pgadmin keycloak-app traefik: Traefik is an ingress controller for Kubernetes deployments that enables dynamic traffic routing and load balancing based on defined rules and configurations. postgresdb: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system.

You may obtain a copy of the license in the corresponding LICENSE file or visit the Apache website for more information. We welcome contributions from the community. If you would like to contribute to the development of OneCX Parameter Management Software, please follow our contribution guidelines (tbd). Parameter Management (Parameter Management) refers to storing and retrieving Parameter items usable in context of OneCX applications. Parameter item Storage and Retrieval: Store and retrieve Parameter items usable in context of OneCX applications. We provide a Quarkus extension that enables applications to seamlessly utilize parameters. For detailed instructions on how to use it, please refer to the following documentation: Onecx Quarkus Parameters Extension. All OneCX Parameter Management issues are tracked and maintained at the issue tracking tool. OneCX Parameter Management Software is a comprehensive solution for managing Parameter items in a user-friendly and efficient manner. It is a solution that consists of three main components: a backend service, a user interface and a backend-for-frontend (BFF) layer. The three components of the OneCX Parameter Management Software are as follows: Parameter Management User Interface (UI) The user interface component is based on Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications. It offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface for interacting with the Parameter Management system. Users can perform actions such as searching and editing of Parameter items. Parameter Management Backend for Frontend (BFF) The BFF layer acts as an intermediary between the frontend user interface and the backend service. It handles tasks such as data aggregation, transformation, and composition to provide an optimized API for the UI. The BFF layer is designed to enhance performance and simplify the integration of the frontend with the backend service. Parameter Management Backend Service (SVC) This component provides the core functionality. It handles tasks such as storage, retrieval and editing of Parameter items. The backend is built cloud native using Quarkus. Interfaces are based on the TM-Forum standard TMF 667. To get started with OneCX Parameter Management Software, please refer to the following installation and setup instructions specific to each component: OneCX Parameter Management UI (User Interface) - Getting Started OneCX Parameter Management BFF (Backend for Frontend) - Getting Started OneCX Parameter Management SVC (Backend) - Getting Started For detailed usage instructions and API documentation, please refer to the respective documentation files for each component. tbd","title":"OneCX Parameter Management","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"index","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-parameter/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Licence","hash":"_licence","id":1},{"text":"Contributing","hash":"_contributing","id":2},{"text":"What is Parameter Management?","hash":"_what_is_parameter_management","id":3},{"text":"Key Features","hash":"_key_features","id":4},{"text":"How to use with Quarkus","hash":"_how_to_use_with_quarkus","id":5},{"text":"Issue tracking","hash":"_issue_tracking","id":6},{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":7},{"text":"Getting Started","hash":"_getting_started","id":8},{"text":"Roadmap","hash":"_roadmap","id":9}]},"231":{"id":231,"text":"The parameter service has been refactored to simplify the handling of parameters. Previously, parameters had a fixed, defined type, and included fields like \"UNIT\", \"rangeFrom\", and \"rangeTo\". The new service allows parameters to be either primitive types or JSON objects, giving applications the flexibility to interpret these objects as needed. Old: Parameters had a fixed, defined type. New: Parameters can be primitive types (e.g., string, number) or JSON objects. Old: Parameters included \"UNIT\", \"rangeFrom\", and \"rangeTo\" fields. New: These fields have been removed. Applications can now include units and range information or any other field within the JSON object if needed. Identify all parameters currently using the \"UNIT\", \"rangeFrom\", and \"rangeTo\" fields. Determine if these parameters can be converted to JSON objects. For parameters requiring units and range information, create a JSON object with fields for these values. Example: { \"value\": 100, \"units\": \"ms\", \"rangeFrom\": 50, \"rangeTo\": 150 } Update application code to handle the new parameter format. Ensure applications correctly interpret JSON objects and extract necessary fields. Test the updated parameter handling to ensure compatibility and correctness. Validate that applications correctly interpret and use the new parameter format. The refactored parameter service offers greater flexibility by allowing parameters to be primitive types or JSON objects. Applications now have the responsibility to interpret these objects, including handling units and range information within the JSON structure.","title":"Migration Guide for 1000kit Parameter

OneCX Parameter Management is a comprehensive solution for managing Parameters for OneCX products in a user-friendly and efficient manner. In this document we are only referring to the user interface (UI) of OneCX Parameter Management. The UI for this Parameter component is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for managing Parameters in the cloud-native environment built with Quarkus. To start developing the OneCX Parameter User Interface, you need to set up your local development environment. It’s recommended that you use WSL as the runtime for your application, as shown in the figure below. If you are using a different runtime, please check that you meet the requirements below. Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 Maven build tool Git Docker + Docker Compose Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - recommended NodeJS Start by cloning the required repositories to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/onecx/onecx-parameter-ui.git git clone https://github.com/onecx/parameter-dev.git The repository onecx-parameter contains the source code of the OneCX Parameter product. The repository onecx-parameter-ui contains the source code of the OneCX Parameter user interface as part of the product. Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses, making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port, we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames. It is recommended that the WSL host file and the Windows host file are aligned. Unless you have disabled this behaviour, the WSL host file will be automatically generated from the Windows host file when WSL is restarted. Open the file C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts in your favorite editor and add the following entries: 127.0.0.1 postgresdb 127.0.0.1 keycloak-app 127.0.0.1 traefik 127.0.0.1 onecx-parameter-ui 127.0.0.1 onecx-parameter-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-parameter-svc If needed, update the file \\etc\\hosts in your favorite linux editor and add the same entries like above. In a local development environment, Docker Compose is used to define and manage multiple containers as a single application stack. It enables developers to easily start, stop, and configure all the necessary services and dependencies required by OneCX Parameters Management using a simple configuration file. mkdir onecx-parameter cd onecx-parameter docker compose up -d traefik postgresdb pgadmin keycloak-app traefik: Traefik is an ingress controller for Kubernetes deployments that enables dynamic traffic routing and load balancing based on defined rules and configurations. postgresdb: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system.

Permission UI Figure 2. Permission management The Role and Permission Management Solution is designed to provide a robust framework for defining and managing user roles and permissions within an organization. This solution ensures that users have appropriate access to resources based on their roles, enhancing security and operational efficiency. Key Features includes: Role Definition: Customizable Roles-: Allows administrators to create and define roles based on organizational needs, specifying the responsibilities and access levels associated with each role. Predefined Roles-: Offers a set of predefined roles that can be used as templates or starting points for customization. Permission Assignment: Granular Permissions-: Provides granular control over permissions, allowing administrators to specify exactly what actions users can perform and what resources they can access. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)-: Implements RBAC to ensure that permissions are assigned based on user roles, simplifying the management of access rights. Visibility and Accessibility Control: Button and Action Visibility-: Controls the visibility and accessibility of buttons, actions, and links based on user roles and permissions. This ensures that users only see and interact with elements relevant to their roles. Dynamic Interface-: Adjusts the user interface dynamically to reflect the permissions and access levels of each user. Integration: System Integration-: Integrates with other enterprise systems to ensure consistent and synchronized role and permission management across platforms. IDM Integration-: Integrates with IDM systems like Key-cloak to streamline user authentication and authorization processes. This ensures that user roles are received and managed centrally, even if they exist across different IDMs. Security and Compliance: Access Control-: Ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive information and perform critical actions. Service BFF Security-: Supports security at the service backend-for-frontend (BFF) layer, ensuring that all service interactions are secure and compliant with organizational policies. Enhanced Security: Ensures that users have appropriate access to resources, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Operational Efficiency: Simplifies the management of roles and permissions, saving time and reducing administrative burden. Flexibility: Offers a high degree of customization, allowing organizations to tailor roles and permissions to their specific needs. Scalability: Supports the growth of the organization by allowing for easy scaling of roles and permissions as the user base expands. Improved User Experience: Controls the visibility and accessibility of interface elements, ensuring a streamlined and relevant user experience. Centralized Identity Management: IDM integration ensures that user identities and roles are managed centrally, enhancing security and consistency across all systems, even when roles exist in multiple IDMs. Figure 3.

If you would like to contribute to the development of OneCX Permission Management Software, please follow our contribution guidelines (tbd). All OneCX Permission issues are tracked and maintained at the issue tracking tool. OneCX Permission Software is a comprehensive solution for managing Permission items in a user-friendly and efficient manner. It is a solution that consists of three main components: a backend service, a user interface and a backend-for-frontend (BFF) layer. The three components of the OneCX Permission Software are as follows: Permission User Interface (UI) The user interface component is based on Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications. It offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface for interacting with the Permission system. Users can perform actions such as searching and editing of Permission items. Permission Backend for Frontend (BFF) The BFF layer acts as an intermediary between the frontend user interface and the backend service. It handles tasks such as data aggregation, transformation, and composition to provide an optimized API for the UI. The BFF layer is designed to enhance performance and simplify the integration of the frontend with the backend service. Permission Backend Service (SVC) This component provides the core functionality. It handles tasks such as storage, retrieval and editing of Permission items. The backend is built cloud native using Quarkus. Interfaces are based on the TM-Forum standard TMF 667. To get started with OneCX Permission Software, please refer to the following installation and setup instructions specific to each component: OneCX Permission UI (User Interface) - Getting Started OneCX Permission BFF (Backend for Frontend) - Getting Started OneCX Permission SVC (Backend) - Getting Started For detailed usage instructions and API documentation, please refer to the respective documentation files for each component. tbd","title":"OneCX Permission Management","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"index","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-permission/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Benefits","hash":"_benefits","id":2},{"text":"UI Examples","hash":"_ui_examples","id":3},{"text":"Licence","hash":"_licence","id":4},{"text":"Contributing","hash":"_contributing","id":5},{"text":"Issue Tracking","hash":"_issue_tracking","id":6},{"text":"Structure Overview","hash":"_structure_overview","id":7},{"text":"Getting Started","hash":"_getting_started","id":8},{"text":"Roadmap","hash":"_roadmap","id":9}]},"247":{"id":247,"text":"Configuration property fixed at build time - All other configuration properties are overridable at runtime Configuration property Type Default onecx.permission.token.verified Verified permission token Environment variable: ONECX_PERMISSION_TOKEN_VERIFIED boolean false onecx.permission.token.issuer.public-key-location.suffix Issuer public key location suffix.

OneCX Permission Management is a comprehensive solution for managing Permissions and Roles for OneCX products in a user-friendly and efficient manner. In this document we are only referring to the user interface (UI) of OneCX Permission Management. The UI for this Permission component is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for managing Permissions and Roles in the cloud-native environment built with Quarkus. To start developing the OneCX Permission User Interface, you need to set up your local development environment. It’s recommended that you use WSL as the runtime for your application, as shown in the figure below. If you are using a different runtime, please check that you meet the requirements below. Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 Maven build tool Git Docker + Docker Compose Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - recommended NodeJS Start by cloning the required repositories to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/onecx/onecx-permission-ui.git git clone https://github.com/onecx/permission-dev.git The repository onecx-permission contains the source code of the OneCX Permission product. The repository onecx-permission-ui contains the source code of the OneCX Permission user interface as part of the product. Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses, making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port, we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames. It is recommended that the WSL host file and the Windows host file are aligned. Unless you have disabled this behaviour, the WSL host file will be automatically generated from the Windows host file when WSL is restarted. Open the file C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts in your favorite editor and add the following entries: 127.0.0.1 onecx-permission-ui 127.0.0.1 onecx-permission-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-permission-svc If needed, update the file \\etc\\hosts in your favorite linux editor and add the same entries like above. In a local development environment, Docker Compose is used to define and manage multiple containers as a single application stack. It enables developers to easily start, stop, and configure all the necessary services and dependencies required by OneCX Permission Management using a simple configuration file. mkdir onecx-permission cd onecx-permission docker compose up -d traefik postgresdb pgadmin keycloak-app","title":"OneCX Permission UI","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"index","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-permission-ui/index.html","titles":[{"text":"What is Permission Management?","hash":"_what_is_permission_management","id":1},{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":2},{"text":"Getting Started","hash":"_getting_started","id":3},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":4},{"text":"Clone the Repository","hash":"_clone_the_repository","id":5},{"text":"Update local DNS resolution","hash":"_update_local_dns_resolution","id":6},{"text":"Update Windows host file","hash":"_update_windows_host_file","id":7},{"text":"Update WSL host file","hash":"_update_wsl_host_file","id":8},{"text":"Starting OneCX dependencies","hash":"_starting_onecx_dependencies","id":9}]},"259":{"id":259,"text":"OneCX Permission Management refers to the systematic process of capturing, organizing, storing, and retrieving Permissions and Roles.

You may obtain a copy of the license in the corresponding LICENSE file or visit the Apache website for more information. We welcome contributions from the community. If you would like to contribute to the development of OneCX Application Store Software, please follow our contribution guidelines (tbd). All OneCX Application Store issues are tracked and maintained at the issue tracking tool. OneCX Application Store consists of three main components: a backend service, a user interface and a backend-for-frontend (BFF) layer. The three components of the OneCX Application Store Software are as follows: Application Store User Interface (UI) The user interface component is based on Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications. It offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface for interacting with the Application Store system. Users can perform actions such as searching and editing of applications and apps. Application Store Backend for Frontend (BFF) The BFF layer acts as an intermediary between the frontend user interface and the backend service. It handles tasks such as data aggregation, transformation, and composition to provide an optimized API for the UI. The BFF layer is designed to enhance performance and simplify the integration of the frontend with the backend service. Application Store Backend Service (SVC) This component provides the core functionality. It handles tasks such as storage, retrieval and editing of applications and apps. The backend is built cloud native using Quarkus. Interfaces are based on the TM-Forum standard TMF 667. To get started with OneCX Application Store Software, please refer to the following installation and setup instructions specific to each component: OneCX Application Store UI (User Interface) - Getting Started OneCX Application Store BFF (Backend for Frontend) - Getting Started OneCX Application Store SVC (Backend) - Getting Started For detailed usage instructions and API documentation, please refer to the respective documentation files for each component. tbd","title":"OneCX Application

Product Store refers to the systematic process of creating, editing and managing OneCX products and apps. OneCX Product Store is a comprehensive solution for managing Help items for OneCX products in a user-friendly and efficient manner. In this document we are only referring to the User Interface (UI) of the OneCX Product Store. The UI for this Product Store component is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for managing Help items in the cloud-native environment built with Quarkus. To start developing the OneCX Product Store UI, you need to set up your local development environment. It’s recommended that you use WSL as the runtime for your application, as shown in the figure below. If you are using a different runtime, please check that you meet the requirements below. Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 Maven build tool Git Docker + Docker Compose Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - recommended NodeJS Start by cloning the required repositories to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/onecx/onecx-product-store-ui.git git clone https://github.com/onecx/help-dev.git The repository onecx-product-store contains the source code of the OneCX Product Store product. The repository onecx-product-store-ui contains the source code of the OneCX Product Store UI as part of the product. Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses, making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port, we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames. It is recommended that the WSL host file and the Windows host file are aligned. Unless you have disabled this behaviour, the WSL host file will be automatically generated from the Windows host file when WSL is restarted. Open the file C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts in your favorite editor and add the following entries: 127.0.0.1 postgresdb 127.0.0.1 keycloak-app 127.0.0.1 traefik 127.0.0.1 onecx-product-store-ui 127.0.0.1 onecx-product-store-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-product-store-svc If needed, update the file \\etc\\hosts in your favorite Linux editor and add the same entries like above. In a local development environment, Docker Compose is used to define and manage multiple containers as a single application stack. It enables developers to easily start, stop, and configure all the necessary services and dependencies required by OneCX Product Store Management using a simple configuration file. mkdir onecx-product-store cd onecx-product-store docker compose up -d traefik postgresdb pgadmin keycloak-app traefik: Traefik is an ingress controller for Kubernetes deployments that enables dynamic traffic routing and load balancing based on defined rules and configurations. postgresdb: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system. It is used as persistence layer for storing and managing data of OneCX products, providing reliability and scalability. pgadmin: pgAdmin is an open-source administration and development platform that offers a user-friendly graphical interface for managing and interacting with the local PostgreSQL database. This is optional. keycloak: Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management system that simplifies authentication, authorization, and single sign-on for web and mobile applications.","title":"","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"index","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-product-store-ui/index.html","titles":[{"text":"onecx-product-store-ui","hash":"_onecx_product_store_ui","id":1},{"text":"OneCX Product Store UI","hash":"_onecx_product_store_ui_2","id":2},{"text":"What is the Product Store?","hash":"_what_is_the_product_store","id":3},{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":4},{"text":"Getting Started","hash":"_getting_started","id":5},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":6},{"text":"Clone the Repository","hash":"_clone_the_repository","id":7},{"text":"Update local DNS resolution","hash":"_update_local_dns_resolution","id":8},{"text":"Update Windows host file","hash":"_update_windows_host_file","id":9},{"text":"Update WSL host file","hash":"_update_wsl_host_file","id":10},{"text":"Starting OneCX dependencies","hash":"_starting_onecx_dependencies","id":11}]},"276":{"id":276,"text":"OneCX Product Store refers to the systematic process of creating, editing and managing OneCX products and apps.

the backbone of OneCX and serves essential data and acts as wrapper for all other applications. tbd To start developing the OneCX Shell User Interface, you need to set up your local development environment. It’s recommended that you use WSL as the runtime for your application, as shown in the figure below. If you are using a different runtime, please check that you meet the requirements below. Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 Maven build tool Git Docker + Docker Compose Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - recommended NodeJS Start by cloning the required repositories to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/onecx/onecx-shell-ui.git The repository onecx-shell contains the source code of the OneCX Shell product. The repository onecx-shell-ui contains the source code of the OneCX Shell user interface as part of the product. Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses, making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port, we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames. It is recommended that the WSL host file and the Windows host file are aligned. Unless you have disabled this behaviour, the WSL host file will be automatically generated from the Windows host file when WSL is restarted. Open the file C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts in your favorite editor and add the following entries: 127.0.0.1 postgresdb 127.0.0.1 keycloak-app 127.0.0.1 traefik 127.0.0.1 onecx-shell-ui 127.0.0.1 onecx-shell-bff If needed, update the file \\etc\\hosts in your favorite linux editor and add the same entries like above. In a local development environment, Docker Compose is used to define and manage multiple containers as a single application stack. It enables developers to easily start, stop, and configure all the necessary services and dependencies required by OneCX Shell using a simple configuration file. mkdir onecx-shell cd onecx-shell docker compose up -d traefik postgresdb pgadmin keycloak-app traefik: Traefik is an ingress controller for Kubernetes deployments that enables dynamic traffic routing and load balancing based on defined rules and configurations. postgresdb: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system. It is used as persistence layer for storing and managing data of OneCX products, providing reliability and scalability. pgadmin: pgAdmin is an open-source administration and development platform that offers a user-friendly graphical interface for managing and interacting with the local PostgreSQL database. This is optional. keycloak: Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management system that simplifies authentication, authorization, and single sign-on for web and mobile applications. Slot Groups are a layout mechanism in OneCX Shell UI that organize multiple slots into structured regions. They enable flexible positioning and dynamic loading of remote components within defined areas of the shell interface’s portal viewport. A Slot Group is a container component that divides content into three distinct regions: start: The beginning region of the slot group center: The middle region of the slot group end: The ending region of the slot group Each slot group automatically creates three named slots based on its name: <name>.start, <name>.center, and <name>.end. Remote components can be loaded into any of these slots dynamically based on configuration. Property Type Description name (required) string Unique identifier for the slot group. Automatically generates three slots: <name>.start, <name>.center, <name>.end direction 'row' | 'row-reverse' | 'column' | 'column-reverse' Controls the flex direction for laying out slots.

This allows remote components to respond dynamically to layout changes. Event Details: Event Type: SLOT_GROUP_RESIZED (from @onecx/integration-interface) Debounce Time: 100ms Payload: slotName: The name of the slot group slotDetails: Object containing width and height properties Implementation: The component uses a ResizeObserver to monitor the slot group’s dimensions. When changes occur, they are debounced and published through the EventsPublisher TopicPublisher, making them available to all micro frontends in the shell. // Remote components can subscribe to resize events eventsPublisher.subscribe(EventType.SLOT_GROUP_RESIZED, (event) => { console.log('Slot group resized:', event.payload.slotName); console.log('New dimensions:', event.payload.slotDetails); }); The onecx-shell-extensions slot is a dedicated slot designed for hosting extension components that enhance Shell UI functionality. The extensions slot provides a standardized integration point for example such as: Utility Components: Tools and helpers Custom Integrations: Third-party or custom micro frontend extensions Extension components are registered through the OneCX slot configuration system and loaded dynamically. Extensions are defined in the slot configuration and can be managed through the OneCX Workspace UI or configured in the helm values yaml file. Each extension component loaded into the onecx-shell-extensions slot receives standard slot inputs and can emit events back to the shell through the OneCX Topic event system. The Shell Toast component provides a centralized, application-wide notification system for displaying messages across the OneCX Shell and all loaded micro frontends. OneCXShellToastComponent is a standalone remote component that can be embedded as a web component. It integrates with the OneCX messaging infrastructure to display toast notifications using PrimeNG components. Key Features: Centralized message handling for all micro frontends PrimeNG Toast integration Automatic subscription to portal-wide messages Translation support for internationalization Word-wrap styling for long messages To enable toast messages by using the OneCXShellToastComponent, it must be configured in the onecx-shell-extensions slot.

We welcome contributions from the community. If you would like to contribute to the development of OneCX Tenant Management Software, please follow our contribution guidelines (tbd). All OneCX Tenant issues are tracked and maintained at the issue tracking tool. OneCX Tenant Software is a comprehensive solution for managing Tenants in a user-friendly and efficient manner. It is a solution that consists of three main components: a backend service, a user interface and a backend-for-frontend (BFF) layer. The three components of the OneCX Tenant Software are as follows: Tenant User Interface (UI) The user interface component is based on Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications. It offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface for interacting with the Tenant system. Users can perform actions such as searching and editing of Tenants. Tenant Backend for Frontend (BFF) The BFF layer acts as an intermediary between the frontend user interface and the backend service. It handles tasks such as data aggregation, transformation, and composition to provide an optimized API for the UI. The BFF layer is designed to enhance performance and simplify the integration of the frontend with the backend service. Tenant Backend Service (SVC) This component provides the core functionality. It handles tasks such as storage, retrieval and editing of Tenants. The backend is built cloud native using Quarkus. Interfaces are based on the TM-Forum standard TMF 667. To get started with OneCX Tenant Software, please refer to the following installation and setup instructions specific to each component: OneCX Tenant UI (User Interface) - Getting Started OneCX Tenant BFF (Backend for Frontend) - Getting Started OneCX Tenant SVC (Backend) - Getting Started For detailed usage instructions and API documentation, please refer to the respective documentation files for each component. tbd","title":"OneCX Tenant Management","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"index","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-tenant/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Benefits","hash":"_benefits","id":2},{"text":"Licence","hash":"_licence","id":3},{"text":"Contributing","hash":"_contributing","id":4},{"text":"Issue Tracking","hash":"_issue_tracking","id":5},{"text":"Structure Overview","hash":"_structure_overview","id":6},{"text":"Getting Started","hash":"_getting_started","id":7},{"text":"Roadmap","hash":"_roadmap","id":8}]},"292":{"id":292,"text":"This backend service takes an Identity token of the user, reads the organization ID from the token and returns the corresponding tenant ID.","title":"","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"docs","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-tenant-svc/docs.html","titles":[]},"293":{"id":293,"text":"This backend service takes an Identity token of the user, reads the organization ID from the token and returns the corresponding tenant ID.

Tenant Management refers to the systematic process of capturing, organizing, storing, and retrieving Tenants. OneCX Tenant is a comprehensive solution for managing Tenants for OneCX products in a user-friendly and efficient manner. In this document we are only referring to the OneCX Tenant User Interface (UI) of OneCX Tenant Management. The UI for this Tenant management component is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for managing Tenants in the cloud-native environment built with Quarkus. To start developing the OneCX Tenant UI, you need to set up your local development environment. It’s recommended that you use WSL as the runtime for your application, as shown in the figure below. If you are using a different runtime, please check that you meet the requirements below. Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 Maven build tool Git Docker + Docker Compose Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - recommended NodeJS Start by cloning the required repositories to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/onecx/onecx-tenant-ui.git git clone https://github.com/onecx/tenant-dev.git The repository onecx-tenant contains the source code of the OneCX Tenant product. The repository onecx-tenant-ui contains the source code of the OneCX Tenant UI as part of the product. Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses, making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port, we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames. It is recommended that the WSL host file and the Windows host file are aligned. Unless you have disabled this behaviour, the WSL host file will be automatically generated from the Windows host file when WSL is restarted. Open the file C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts in your favorite editor and add the following entries: 127.0.0.1 postgresdb 127.0.0.1 keycloak-app 127.0.0.1 traefik 127.0.0.1 onecx-tenant-ui 127.0.0.1 onecx-tenant-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-tenant-svc If needed, update the file \\etc\\hosts in your favorite linux editor and add the same entries like above. In a local development environment, Docker Compose is used to define and manage multiple containers as a single application stack. It enables developers to easily start, stop, and configure all the necessary services and dependencies required by OneCX Tenant Management using a simple configuration file. mkdir onecx-tenant cd onecx-tenant docker compose up -d traefik postgresdb pgadmin keycloak-app traefik: Traefik is an ingress controller for Kubernetes deployments that enables dynamic traffic routing and load balancing based on defined rules and configurations. postgresdb: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system. It is used as persistence layer for storing and managing data of OneCX products, providing reliability and scalability. pgadmin: pgAdmin is an open-source administration and development platform that offers a user-friendly graphical interface for managing and interacting with the local PostgreSQL database. This is optional. keycloak: Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management system that simplifies authentication, authorization, and single sign-on for web and mobile applications.","title":"","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"index","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-tenant-ui/index.html","titles":[{"text":"onecx-tenant-ui","hash":"_onecx_tenant_ui","id":1},{"text":"OneCX Tenant UI","hash":"_onecx_tenant_ui_2","id":2},{"text":"What is Tenant Management?","hash":"_what_is_tenant_management","id":3},{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":4},{"text":"Getting Started","hash":"_getting_started","id":5},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":6},{"text":"Clone the Repository","hash":"_clone_the_repository","id":7},{"text":"Update local DNS resolution","hash":"_update_local_dns_resolution","id":8},{"text":"Update Windows host file","hash":"_update_windows_host_file","id":9},{"text":"Update WSL host file","hash":"_update_wsl_host_file","id":10},{"text":"Starting OneCX dependencies","hash":"_starting_onecx_dependencies","id":11}]},"305":{"id":305,"text":"OneCX Tenant Management refers to the systematic process of capturing, organizing, storing, and retrieving Tenants.

If you would like to contribute to the development of OneCX Theme Management Software, please follow our contribution guidelines (tbd). All OneCX Theme issues are tracked and maintained at the issue tracking tool. OneCX Theme Software is a comprehensive solution for managing Themes in a user-friendly and efficient manner. It is a solution that consists of three main components: a backend service, a user interface and a backend-for-frontend (BFF) layer. The three components of the OneCX Theme Software are as follows: Theme User Interface (UI) The user interface component is based on Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications. It offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface for interacting with the Theme system. Users can perform actions such as searching and editing of Themes. Theme Backend for Frontend (BFF) The BFF layer acts as an intermediary between the frontend user interface and the backend service. It handles tasks such as data aggregation, transformation, and composition to provide an optimized API for the UI. The BFF layer is designed to enhance performance and simplify the integration of the frontend with the backend service. Theme Backend Service (SVC) This component provides the core functionality. It handles tasks such as storage, retrieval and editing of Themes. The backend is built cloud native using Quarkus. Interfaces are based on the TM-Forum standard TMF 667. To get started with OneCX Theme Software, please refer to the following installation and setup instructions specific to each component: OneCX Theme UI (User Interface) - Getting Started OneCX Theme BFF (Backend for Frontend) - Getting Started OneCX Theme SVC (Backend) - Getting Started For detailed usage instructions and API documentation, please refer to the respective documentation files for each component. tbd","title":"OneCX Theme

Theme Management refers to the systematic process of capturing, organizing, storing, and retrieving Theme items. OneCX Theme is a comprehensive solution for managing Theme items for OneCX products in a user-friendly and efficient manner. In this document we are only referring to the OneCX Theme User Interface (UI) of OneCX Theme Management. The UI for this Theme management component is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for managing Theme items in the cloud-native environment built with Quarkus. To start developing the OneCX Theme UI, you need to set up your local development environment. It’s recommended that you use WSL as the runtime for your application, as shown in the figure below. If you are using a different runtime, please check that you meet the requirements below. Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 Maven build tool Git Docker + Docker Compose Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - recommended NodeJS Start by cloning the required repositories to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/onecx/onecx-Theme-ui.git git clone https://github.com/onecx/Theme-dev.git The repository onecx-Theme contains the source code of the OneCX Theme product. The repository onecx-Theme-ui contains the source code of the OneCX Theme UI as part of the product. Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses, making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port, we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames. It is recommended that the WSL host file and the Windows host file are aligned. Unless you have disabled this behaviour, the WSL host file will be automatically generated from the Windows host file when WSL is restarted. Open the file C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts in your favorite editor and add the following entries: 127.0.0.1 postgresdb 127.0.0.1 keycloak-app 127.0.0.1 traefik 127.0.0.1 onecx-Theme-ui 127.0.0.1 onecx-Theme-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-Theme-svc If needed, update the file \\etc\\hosts in your favorite linux editor and add the same entries like above. In a local development environment, Docker Compose is used to define and manage multiple containers as a single application stack. It enables developers to easily start, stop, and configure all the necessary services and dependencies required by OneCX Theme Management using a simple configuration file. mkdir onecx-Theme cd onecx-Theme docker compose up -d traefik postgresdb pgadmin keycloak-app traefik: Traefik is an ingress controller for Kubernetes deployments that enables dynamic traffic routing and load balancing based on defined rules and configurations. postgresdb: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system.

If you would like to contribute to the development of OneCX User Profile Software, please follow our contribution guidelines (tbd). All OneCX User Profile issues are tracked and maintained at the issue tracking tool. OneCX User Profile Software is a comprehensive solution for managing User Profiles in a user-friendly and efficient manner. It is a solution that consists of three main components: a backend service, a user interface and a backend-for-frontend (BFF) layer. The three components of the OneCX User Profile Software are as follows: User Profile User Interface (UI) The user interface component is based on Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications. It offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface for interacting with the User Profile system. Users can perform actions such as searching and editing of User Profiles. User Profile Backend for Frontend (BFF) The BFF layer acts as an intermediary between the frontend user interface and the backend service. It handles tasks such as data aggregation, transformation, and composition to provide an optimized API for the UI. The BFF layer is designed to enhance performance and simplify the integration of the frontend with the backend service. User Profile Backend Service (SVC) This component provides the core functionality. It handles tasks such as storage, retrieval and editing of User Profiles. The backend is built cloud native using Quarkus. Interfaces are based on the TM-Forum standard TMF 667. To get started with OneCX User Profile Software, please refer to the following installation and setup instructions specific to each component: OneCX User Profile UI (User Interface) - Getting Started OneCX User Profile BFF (Backend for Frontend) - Getting Started OneCX User Profile SVC (Backend) - Getting Started For detailed usage instructions and API documentation, please refer to the respective documentation files for each component. tbd","title":"OneCX User

User Profile refers to the systematic process of capturing, organizing, storing, and retrieving User Profiles. OneCX User Profile is a comprehensive solution for managing User Profiles for OneCX products in a user-friendly and efficient manner. In this document we are only referring to the OneCX User Profile User Interface (UI) of OneCX User Profile. The UI for this User Profile component is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for managing User Profiles in the cloud-native environment built with Quarkus. To start developing the OneCX User Profile UI, you need to set up your local development environment. It’s recommended that you use WSL as the runtime for your application, as shown in the figure below. If you are using a different runtime, please check that you meet the requirements below. Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 Maven build tool Git Docker + Docker Compose Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - recommended NodeJS Start by cloning the required repositories to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/onecx/onecx-user-profile-ui.git git clone https://github.com/onecx/user-profile-dev.git The repository onecx-user-profile contains the source code of the OneCX User Profile product. The repository onecx-user-profile-ui contains the source code of the OneCX User Profile UI as part of the product. Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses, making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port, we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames. It is recommended that the WSL host file and the Windows host file are aligned. Unless you have disabled this behaviour, the WSL host file will be automatically generated from the Windows host file when WSL is restarted. Open the file C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts in your favorite editor and add the following entries: 127.0.0.1 postgresdb 127.0.0.1 keycloak-app 127.0.0.1 traefik 127.0.0.1 onecx-user-profile-ui 127.0.0.1 onecx-user-profile-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-user-profile-svc If needed, update the file \\etc\\hosts in your favorite Linux editor and add the same entries like above. In a local development environment, Docker Compose is used to define and manage multiple containers as a single application stack. It enables developers to easily start, stop, and configure all the necessary services and dependencies required by OneCX User Profile using a simple configuration file. mkdir onecx-user-profile cd onecx-user-profile docker compose up -d traefik postgresdb pgadmin keycloak-app traefik: Traefik is an ingress controller for Kubernetes deployments that enables dynamic traffic routing and load balancing based on defined rules and configurations. postgresdb: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system. It is used as persistence layer for storing and managing data of OneCX products, providing reliability and scalability. pgadmin: pgAdmin is an open-source administration and development platform that offers a user-friendly graphical interface for managing and interacting with the local PostgreSQL database. This is optional. keycloak: Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management system that simplifies authentication, authorization, and single sign-on for web and mobile applications.","title":"","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"index","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-user-profile-ui/index.html","titles":[{"text":"onecx-user-profile-ui","hash":"_onecx_user_profile_ui","id":1},{"text":"OneCX User Profile UI","hash":"_onecx_user_profile_ui_2","id":2},{"text":"What is User Profile?","hash":"_what_is_user_profile","id":3},{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":4},{"text":"Getting Started","hash":"_getting_started","id":5},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":6},{"text":"Clone the Repository","hash":"_clone_the_repository","id":7},{"text":"Update local DNS resolution","hash":"_update_local_dns_resolution","id":8},{"text":"Update Windows host file","hash":"_update_windows_host_file","id":9},{"text":"Update WSL host file","hash":"_update_wsl_host_file","id":10},{"text":"Starting OneCX dependencies","hash":"_starting_onecx_dependencies","id":11}]},"345":{"id":345,"text":"OneCX User Profile refers to the systematic process of capturing, organizing, storing, and retrieving User Profiles.

Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses, making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port, we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames. It is recommended that the WSL host file and the Windows host file are aligned. Unless you have disabled this behaviour, the WSL host file will be automatically generated from the Windows host file when WSL is restarted. Open the file C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts in your favorite editor and add the following entries: 127.0.0.1 postgresdb 127.0.0.1 keycloak-app 127.0.0.1 traefik 127.0.0.1 onecx-user-profile-ui 127.0.0.1 onecx-user-profile-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-user-profile-svc If needed, update the file \\etc\\hosts in your favorite Linux editor and add the same entries like above. In a local development environment, Docker Compose is used to define and manage multiple containers as a single application stack. It enables developers to easily start, stop, and configure all the necessary services and dependencies required by OneCX User Profile using a simple configuration file. mkdir onecx-user-profile cd onecx-user-profile docker compose up -d traefik postgresdb pgadmin keycloak-app traefik: Traefik is an ingress controller for Kubernetes deployments that enables dynamic traffic routing and load balancing based on defined rules and configurations. postgresdb: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system. It is used as persistence layer for storing and managing data of OneCX products, providing reliability and scalability. pgadmin: pgAdmin is an open-source administration and development platform that offers a user-friendly graphical interface for managing and interacting with the local PostgreSQL database. This is optional. keycloak: Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management system that simplifies authentication, authorization, and single sign-on for web and mobile applications.","title":"","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"onecx-user-profile-ui-docs","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-user-profile-ui/onecx-user-profile-ui-docs.html","titles":[{"text":"OneCX User Profile UI","hash":"_onecx_user_profile_ui","id":1},{"text":"What is User Profile?","hash":"_what_is_user_profile","id":2},{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":3},{"text":"Getting Started","hash":"_getting_started","id":4},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":5},{"text":"Clone the Repository","hash":"_clone_the_repository","id":6},{"text":"Update local DNS resolution","hash":"_update_local_dns_resolution","id":7},{"text":"Update Windows host file","hash":"_update_windows_host_file","id":8},{"text":"Update WSL host file","hash":"_update_wsl_host_file","id":9},{"text":"Starting OneCX dependencies","hash":"_starting_onecx_dependencies","id":10}]},"346":{"id":346,"text":"Figure 1.

If you would like to contribute to the development of OneCX Welcome Management Software, please follow our contribution guidelines (tbd). All OneCX Welcome issues are tracked and maintained at the issue tracking tool. OneCX Welcome Software is a comprehensive solution for managing Welcome screens in a user-friendly and efficient manner. It is a solution that consists of three main components: a backend service, a user interface and a backend-for-frontend (BFF) layer. The three components of the OneCX Welcome Software are as follows: Welcome User Interface (UI) The user interface component is based on Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications. It offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface for interacting with the Welcome system. Users can perform actions such as searching and editing of Welcome screens. Welcome Backend for Frontend (BFF) The BFF layer acts as an intermediary between the frontend user interface and the backend service. It handles tasks such as data aggregation, transformation, and composition to provide an optimized API for the UI. The BFF layer is designed to enhance performance and simplify the integration of the frontend with the backend service. Welcome Backend Service (SVC) This component provides the core functionality. It handles tasks such as storage, retrieval and editing of Welcome screens. The backend is built cloud native using Quarkus. Interfaces are based on the TM-Forum standard TMF 667. To get started with OneCX Welcome Software, please refer to the following installation and setup instructions specific to each component: OneCX Welcome UI (User Interface) - Getting Started OneCX Welcome BFF (Backend for Frontend) - Getting Started OneCX Welcome SVC (Backend) - Getting Started For detailed usage instructions and API documentation, please refer to the respective documentation

Welcome Management refers to the systematic process of setting up a Welcome screen or landing page for the user and managing the pictures to be shown there. OneCX Welcome is a comprehensive solution for managing Welcome screens of OneCX products in a user-friendly and efficient manner. In this document we are only referring to the OneCX Welcome User Interface (UI) of OneCX Welcome Management. The UI for this Welcome Management component is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for managing Welcome screens in the cloud-native environment built with Quarkus. To start developing the OneCX Welcome UI, you need to set up your local development environment. It’s recommended that you use WSL as the runtime for your application, as shown in the figure below. If you are using a different runtime, please check that you meet the requirements below. Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 Maven build tool Git Docker + Docker Compose Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - recommended NodeJS Start by cloning the required repositories to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/onecx/onecx-welcome-ui.git git clone https://github.com/onecx/welcome-dev.git The repository onecx-welcome contains the source code of the OneCX Welcome product. The repository onecx-welcome-ui contains the source code of the OneCX Welcome UI as part of the product. Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses, making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port, we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames. It is recommended that the WSL host file and the Windows host file are aligned. Unless you have disabled this behaviour, the WSL host file will be automatically generated from the Windows host file when WSL is restarted. Open the file C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts in your favorite editor and add the following entries: 127.0.0.1 postgresdb 127.0.0.1 keycloak-app 127.0.0.1 traefik 127.0.0.1 onecx-welcome-ui 127.0.0.1 onecx-welcome-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-welcome-svc If needed, update the file \\etc\\hosts in your favorite linux editor and add the same entries like above. In a local development environment, Docker Compose is used to define and manage multiple containers as a single application stack. It enables developers to easily start, stop, and configure all the necessary services and dependencies required by OneCX Welcome Management using a simple configuration file. mkdir onecx-welcome cd onecx-welcome docker compose up -d traefik postgresdb pgadmin keycloak-app traefik: Traefik is an ingress controller for Kubernetes deployments that enables dynamic traffic routing and load balancing based on defined rules and configurations. postgresdb: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system.

If you would like to contribute to the development of OneCX Workspace Management Software, please follow our contribution guidelines (tbd). All OneCX Workspace issues are tracked and maintained at the issue tracking tool. OneCX Workspace Software is a comprehensive solution for managing Workspaces in a user-friendly and efficient manner. It is a solution that consists of three main components: a backend service, a user interface and a backend-for-frontend (BFF) layer. The three components of the OneCX Workspace Software are as follows: Workspace User Interface (UI) The user interface component is based on Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications. It offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface for interacting with the Workspace system. Users can perform actions such as searching and editing of Workspaces. Workspace Backend for Frontend (BFF) The BFF layer acts as an intermediary between the frontend user interface and the backend service. It handles tasks such as data aggregation, transformation, and composition to provide an optimized API for the UI. The BFF layer is designed to enhance performance and simplify the integration of the frontend with the backend service. Workspace Backend Service (SVC) This component provides the core functionality. It handles tasks such as storage, retrieval and editing of Workspaces. The backend is built cloud native using Quarkus. Interfaces are based on the TM-Forum standard TMF 667. To get started with OneCX Workspace Software, please refer to the following installation and setup instructions specific to each component: OneCX Workspace UI (User Interface) - Getting Started OneCX Workspace BFF (Backend for Frontend) - Getting Started OneCX Workspace SVC (Backend) - Getting Started For detailed usage instructions and API documentation, please refer to the respective documentation files for each component. tbd","title":"OneCX Workspace Management","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"index","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-workspace/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"overview","id":1},{"text":"Benefits","hash":"benefits","id":2},{"text":"Dialogues","hash":"dialogues","id":3},{"text":"Workspace General Data","hash":"workspace-general-data","id":4},{"text":"Workspace Role Management","hash":"workspace-role-management","id":5},{"text":"Workspace Application Registration","hash":"workspace-application-registration","id":6},{"text":"Workspace Menu Management","hash":"workspace-menu-management","id":7},{"text":"Workspace Slots","hash":"workspace-slots","id":8},{"text":"Licence","hash":"licence","id":9},{"text":"Contributing","hash":"contributing","id":10},{"text":"Issue Tracking","hash":"issue-tracking","id":11},{"text":"Structure Overview","hash":"structure-overview","id":12},{"text":"Getting Started","hash":"getting-started","id":13},{"text":"Roadmap","hash":"roadmap","id":14}]},"358":{"id":358,"text":"Configuration property fixed at build time - All other configuration properties are overridable at runtime Configuration property Type Default onecx.workspace.template.import.role-mapping.\"role-mapping\" Role mapping for the template import Environment variable: ONECX_WORKSPACE_TEMPLATE_IMPORT_ROLE_MAPPING__ROLE_MAPPING_ Map<String,String> onecx.workspace.template.import.tenants Template import tenants Environment variable: ONECX_WORKSPACE_TEMPLATE_IMPORT_TENANTS list of string default onecx.workspace.template.create.enabled Enabled or enable create template configuration.

Workspace Management refers to the process of creating, editing, deleting and transferring workspaces and their applications, slots and roles. OneCX Workspace is a comprehensive solution for managing workspaces in a user-friendly and efficient manner. In this document we are only referring to the OneCX Workspace User Interface (UI) of OneCX Workspace Management. The UI for this Workspace Management component is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for managing workspaces in the cloud-native environment built with Quarkus. To start developing the OneCX Workspace UI, you need to set up your local development environment. It’s recommended that you use WSL as the runtime for your application, as shown in the figure below. If you are using a different runtime, please check that you meet the requirements below. Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 Maven build tool Git Docker + Docker Compose Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - recommended NodeJS Start by cloning the required repositories to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/onecx/onecx-workspace-ui.git git clone https://github.com/onecx/workspace-dev.git The repository onecx-workspace contains the source code of the OneCX Workspace product. The repository onecx-workspace-ui contains the source code of the OneCX Workspace UI as part of the product. Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses, making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port, we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames. It is recommended that the WSL host file and the Windows host file are aligned. Unless you have disabled this behaviour, the WSL host file will be automatically generated from the Windows host file when WSL is restarted. Open the file C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts in your favorite editor and add the following entries: 127.0.0.1 postgresdb 127.0.0.1 keycloak-app 127.0.0.1 traefik 127.0.0.1 onecx-workspace-ui 127.0.0.1 onecx-workspace-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-workspace-svc If needed, update the file \\etc\\hosts in your favorite linux editor and add the same entries like above. In a local development environment, Docker Compose is used to define and manage multiple containers as a single application stack. It enables developers to easily start, stop, and configure all the necessary services and dependencies required by OneCX Workspace Management using a simple configuration file. mkdir onecx-workspace cd onecx-workspace docker compose up -d traefik postgresdb pgadmin keycloak-app traefik: Traefik is an ingress controller for Kubernetes deployments that enables dynamic traffic routing and load balancing based on defined rules and configurations. postgresdb: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system. It is used as persistence layer for storing and managing data of OneCX products, providing reliability and scalability. pgadmin: pgAdmin is an open-source administration and development platform that offers a user-friendly graphical interface for managing and interacting with the local PostgreSQL database.

OneCX Document Management Software is a comprehensive solution for managing documents in a user-friendly and efficient manner. It is a solution that consists of three main components: a backend service, a user interface, and a backend-for-frontend (BFF) layer. The three components of OneCX Document Management Software are as follows: Document Management UI The user interface component is based on Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications. It offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface for interacting with the document management system. Users can perform actions such as uploading documents, searching, linking them with others or attaching files to it, etc.. Document Management BFF The BFF layer acts as an intermediary between the frontend user interface and the backend service. It handles tasks such as data aggregation, transformation, and composition to provide an optimized API for the UI. The BFF layer is designed to enhance performance and simplify the integration of the frontend with the backend service. Document Management Backend This component provides the core functionality for document management. It handles tasks such as document storage, retrieval, metadata management, and access control. The backend is built cloud native using Quarkus. Interfaces are based on the TM-Forum standard TMF 667. To get started with OneCX Document Management Software, please refer to the following installation and setup instructions specific to each component: OneCX Document Management SVC (Backend) - Getting Started OneCX Document Management UI (User Interface) - Getting Started OneCX Document Management BFF (Backend for Frontend) - Getting Started For detailed usage instructions and API documentation, please refer to the respective documentation files for each component. tbd","title":"Document Management","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"index","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-document-management/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Licence","hash":"_licence","id":1},{"text":"Contributing","hash":"_contributing","id":2},{"text":"What is Document Management","hash":"_what_is_document_management","id":3},{"text":"Key Features","hash":"_key_features","id":4},{"text":"Flexibility and Integration","hash":"_flexibility_and_integration","id":5},{"text":"Issue tracking","hash":"_issue_tracking","id":6},{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":7},{"text":"Getting Started","hash":"_getting_started","id":8},{"text":"Roadmap","hash":"_roadmap","id":9}]},"382":{"id":382,"text":"src/main/resources/application.properties quarkus.http.auth.permission.health.paths=/q/* quarkus.http.auth.permission.health.policy=permit quarkus.http.auth.permission.default.paths=/* quarkus.http.auth.permission.default.policy=authenticated quarkus.banner.enabled=false quarkus.http.limits.max-body-size=20240K quarkus.liquibase.migrate-at-start=true quarkus.datasource.db-kind=postgresql quarkus.datasource.jdbc.max-size=8 quarkus.datasource.jdbc.min-size=2 quarkus.datasource.metrics.enabled=true quarkus.hibernate-orm.metrics.enabled=true quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation=none quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation.halt-on-error=true quarkus.hibernate-orm.jdbc.timezone=UTC quarkus.log.category.\"org.hibernate.engine.internal.StatisticalLoggingSessionEventListener\".level=WARNING quarkus.jacoco.excludes=**/mappers/*,**/minio/* tkit.log.json.enabled=true tkit.log.json.keys.type=rs-time=double,time=double,rs-response-status=int tkit.log.json.keys.mdc=traceId=X-B3-TraceId,spanId=X-B3-SpanId tkit.log.json.keys.ignore=loggerClassName,ndc tkit.log.json.keys.override=timestamp=@timestamp,threadName=thread,loggerName=source tkit.log.json.keys.env=service_domain=SERVICE_DOMAIN minio.bucket.folder=test-bucket quarkus.jacoco.excludes=**/mappers/* ## TEST quarkus.minio.secure=false Extensions Documentation Configuration Version tkit-quarkus-log-rs Link Link 2.36.0 tkit-quarkus-log-cdi Link Link 2.36.0 tkit-quarkus-log-json Link Link 2.36.0 tkit-quarkus-jpa Link Link 2.36.0 tkit-quarkus-rest Link Link 2.36.0 quarkus-rest Link Link 3.15.1 quarkus-rest-jackson Link 3.15.1 quarkus-arc Link Link 3.15.1 quarkus-smallrye-openapi Link Link 3.15.1 quarkus-liquibase Link Link 3.15.1 quarkus-jdbc-postgresql Link Link 3.15.1 quarkus-hibernate-validator Link Link 3.15.1 quarkus-smallrye-jwt Link Link 3.15.1 quarkus-smallrye-health Link Link 3.15.1 quarkus-resteasy-reactive Link Link 3.15.1 quarkus-oidc Link Link 3.15.1 tkit-quarkus-security Link Link 2.36.0 onecx-core Link 0.34.0 quarkus-micrometer-registry-prometheus Link Link 3.15.1 quarkus-opentelemetry Link Link 3.15.1 quarkus-container-image-docker Link Link 3.15.1 onecx-security 0.34.0 quarkus-scheduler 3.15.1 quarkus-minio 3.7.7 Docker registry Helm registry Default values src/main/helm/values.yaml app: image: repository: \"onecx-apps/onecx-document-management-svc\" db: enabled: true product: false Document management refers to the systematic process of capturing, organizing, storing, and retrieving documents within an organization.

Whether it’s managing contracts, invoices, legal documents, or any other form of digital content, OneCX Document Management provides a centralized and user-friendly solution for effectively managing your documents. All OneCX Document Management issues are tracked and maintained here issue tracking tool. OneCX-Document-Management is a comprehensive solution for managing documents in a user-friendly and efficient manner. It is a solution that consists of three main components which are explained in more detail in the general documentation. Please refer to the following documentation to learn more Document-Management Documenation. However, in this document we are only referring to one of the three components, the OneCX-Document-Management-Service (Backend) of OneCX-Document-Management. This component provides the core functionality for document management. It handles tasks such as document storage, retrieval, metadata management, and access control. The backend is built cloud native using Quarkus. To start developing the OneCX Document Management Service, you need to set up your local development environment. It’s recommended that you use WSL as the runtime for your application, as shown in the figure below. If you are using a different runtime, please check that you meet the requirements below. Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 Maven build tool Git Docker + Docker Compose (Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) recommended) Start by cloning the required repositories to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/onecx-apps/onecx-document-management-svc.git git clone https://github.com/onecx-apps/document-management-dev.git The repository onecx-document-management contains the source code of the document management backend. The repository document-management-dev contains the necessary OneCX platform dependencies and the docker-compose script required to run the OneCX Document-Management-Service on your local machine. Navigate to the project directory and build the application using Maven: cd onecx-document-management-svc mvn clean install Downloading the required Maven dependencies for the first time may take some time. Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses, making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port, we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames. It is recommended that the WSL host file and the Windows host file are aligned. Unless you have disabled this behaviour, the WSL host file will be automatically generated from the Windows host file when WSL is restarted. Open the file C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts in your favorite editor and add the following entries: 127.0.0.1 pgadmin 127.0.0.1 postgresdb 127.0.0.1 keycloak-app 127.0.0.1 traefik 127.0.0.1 tkit-portal-app 127.0.0.1 tkit-portal-server 127.0.0.1 apm 127.0.0.1 wiremock 127.0.0.1 minio 127.0.0.1 onecx-document-management-ui 127.0.0.1 onecx-document-management-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-document-management-svc If needed, update the file \\etc\\hosts in your favorite linux editor and add the same entries like above. In a local development environment, Docker Compose is used to define and manage multiple containers as a single application stack. It enables developers to easily start, stop, and configure all the necessary services and dependencies required by OneCX Document Management using a simple configuration file. cd document-management-dev docker compose up -d traefik postgresdb pgadmin keycloak-app tkit-portal-server minio apm traefik: Traefik is an ingress controller for Kubernetes deployments that enables dynamic traffic routing and load balancing based on defined rules and configurations. postgresdb: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system. It is used as persistence layer for storing and managing data in OneCX Document Management, providing reliability and scalability. pgadmin: pgAdmin is an open-source administration and development platform that offers a user-friendly graphical interface for managing and interacting with the local PostgreSQL database. keycloak: Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management system that simplifies authentication, authorization, and single sign-on for web and mobile applications. tkit-portal-server: This micro-service is responsible mostly for handling the logic of portals and their meunitems and user data and settings. minio: We use MinIO as a facade or abstraction layer to decouple our applications from the underlying cloud storage provider, providing greater flexibility and allowing us to seamlessly switch between different providers without changing our application code. It acts as a unified interface, enabling us to interact with various cloud storage systems using the standardized Amazon S3 API. apm: In this backend, user permissions are stored in a structured manner and an endpoint is provided to import permissions via CSV files. Each application can be assigned a set of roles and permissions, managed through an association table in the APM database. Roles are assigned in the Keycloak admin console and are retrieved from tokens, while strings defined in APM are used to grant access to specific components or views on the frontend. The docker-compose stop command is used to stop the containers defined in a Docker Compose file. It gracefully stops the running containers by sending a stop signal, allowing them to perform any necessary cleanup tasks before shutting down. docker compose stop The command mvn compile quarkus:dev is used in a Maven-based Quarkus project to compile the source code and start a live coding development mode. In this mode, Quarkus will automatically rebuild and redeploy the application whenever changes are detected in the source code, allowing for rapid development and testing. mvn compile quarkus:dev mvn compile: This command tells Maven to compile the source code of the project. It resolves dependencies, compiles the Java source files, and generates the compiled bytecode. quarkus:dev: This is a Maven plugin goal provided by the Quarkus framework. It starts the Quarkus dev mode, which is a live coding mode for development. It launches your application in development mode, which includes features like hot-reloading and automatic recompilation. When you run mvn compile quarkus:dev, the build process compiles your application, and once it’s built, Quarkus starts a development server that listens for changes in the source code.

It involves the efficient handling of digital documents, ensuring secure access, version control, collaboration based on TM-Forum standard TMF 667. With OneCX-Document-Management Software, you can streamline your document management workflows, reduce manual efforts, and enhance productivity. Whether it’s managing contracts, invoices, legal documents, or any other form of digital content, OneCX Document Management provides a centralized and user-friendly solution for effectively managing your documents. OneCX-Document-Management is a comprehensive solution for managing documents in a user-friendly and efficient manner. It is a solution that consists of three main components which are explained in more detail in the general documentation. Please refer to the following documentation to learn more Document-Management Documenation. However, in this document we are only referring to one of the three components, the OneCX-Document-Management-User-Interface (UI) of OneCX-Document-Management. The user interface (UI) for this document management component is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for managing documents in the cloud-native environment built with Quarkus. To start developing the OneCX Document Management User Interface, you need to set up your local development environment. It’s recommended that you use WSL as the runtime for your application, as shown in the figure below. If you are using a different runtime, please check that you meet the requirements below. Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 Maven build tool Git Docker + Docker Compose (Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) recommended) NodeJS Start by cloning the required repositories to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/onecx-apps/onecx-document-management-ui.git git clone https://github.com/onecx-apps/document-management-dev.git The repository onecx-document-management-ui contains the source code of the document management user interface. The repository document-management-dev contains the necessary OneCX platform dependencies and the docker-compose script required to run the OneCX Document-Management-User-Interface on your local machine. Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses, making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port, we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames. It is recommended that the WSL host file and the Windows host file are aligned. Unless you have disabled this behaviour, the WSL host file will be automatically generated from the Windows host file when WSL is restarted. Open the file C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts in your favorite editor and add the following entries: 127.0.0.1 pgadmin 127.0.0.1 postgresdb 127.0.0.1 keycloak-app 127.0.0.1 traefik 127.0.0.1 tkit-portal-app 127.0.0.1 tkit-portal-server 127.0.0.1 apm 127.0.0.1 wiremock 127.0.0.1 minio 127.0.0.1 onecx-document-management-ui 127.0.0.1 onecx-document-management-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-document-management-svc If needed, update the file \\etc\\hosts in your favorite linux editor and add the same entries like above. In a local development environment, Docker Compose is used to define and manage multiple containers as a single application stack. It enables developers to easily start, stop, and configure all the necessary services and dependencies required by OneCX Document Management using a simple configuration file. cd document-management-dev docker compose up -d traefik postgresdb pgadmin keycloak-app tkit-portal-server minio apm traefik: Traefik is an ingress controller for Kubernetes deployments that enables dynamic traffic routing and load balancing based on defined rules and configurations. postgresdb: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system. It is used as persistence layer for storing and managing data in OneCX Document Management, providing reliability and scalability. pgadmin: pgAdmin is an open-source administration and development platform that offers a user-friendly graphical interface for managing and interacting with the local PostgreSQL database. keycloak: Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management system that simplifies authentication, authorization, and single sign-on for web and mobile applications. tkit-portal-server: This micro-service is responsible mostly for handling the logic of portals and their meunitems and user data and settings. minio: We use MinIO as a facade or abstraction layer to decouple our applications from the underlying cloud storage provider, providing greater flexibility and allowing us to seamlessly switch between different providers without changing our application code. It acts as a unified interface, enabling us to interact with various cloud storage systems using the standardized Amazon S3 API. apm: In this backend, user permissions are stored in a structured manner and an endpoint is provided to import permissions via CSV files. Each application can be assigned a set of roles and permissions, managed through an association table in the APM database. Roles are assigned in the Keycloak admin console and are retrieved from tokens, while strings defined in APM are used to grant access to specific components or views on the frontend. Navigate to the project directory and build the application using NPM: cd onecx-document-management-ui npm install --force Note: If you face any issues while npm install, try deleting the node_module folder and package-lock.json from the project. Start the user interface: cd onecx-document-management-ui npm start The docker compose stop command is used to stop the containers defined in a Docker Compose file. It gracefully stops the running containers by sending a stop signal, allowing them to perform any necessary cleanup tasks before shutting down. cd onecx-document-management-dev docker compose stop","title":"","component":"documentation","version":"latest","name":"index","url":"/documentation/current/onecx-document-management-ui/index.html","titles":[{"text":"OneCX Document-Management-User-Interface","hash":"_onecx_document_management_user_interface","id":1},{"text":"What is Document Management","hash":"_what_is_document_management","id":2},{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":3},{"text":"Getting Started","hash":"_getting_started","id":4},{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":5},{"text":"Clone the Repository","hash":"_clone_the_repository","id":6},{"text":"Update local DNS resolution","hash":"_update_local_dns_resolution","id":7},{"text":"Update Windows host file","hash":"_update_windows_host_file","id":8},{"text":"Update WSL host file","hash":"_update_wsl_host_file","id":9},{"text":"Starting OneCX dependencies","hash":"_starting_onecx_dependencies","id":10},{"text":"Starting the OneCX Document Management User Interface","hash":"_starting_the_onecx_document_management_user_interface","id":11},{"text":"Stopping OneCX dependencies","hash":"_stopping_onecx_dependencies","id":12}]},"387":{"id":387,"text":"src/main/resources/application.properties documentmgmt/mp-rest/url=http://onecx-document-management-svc:8080 documentmgmt/mp-rest/forward-headers=true apm/mp-rest/url=http://tkit-apm:8080/tkit-apm-rs/v2 ahm/mp-rest/url=http://announcement-help-management:8080 portalLaunchpad/mp-rest/url=http://portal-launchpad:8080 tkitPortalServer/mp-rest/url=http://tkit-portal-server:8080 mp.openapi.scan.disable=false tkit.log.json.enabled=false org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.propagateHeaders=apm-principal-token quarkus.oidc-client.client-id=${quarkus.application.name} smallrye.jwt.path.groups =realm_access/roles quarkus.http.limits.max-body-size=20240K dms.file-upload.proxy-path=/v1/document/files/upload/* quarkus.http.auth.permission.health.paths=/q/* quarkus.http.auth.permission.health.policy=permit quarkus.http.auth.permission.default.paths=/* quarkus.http.auth.permission.default.policy=authenticated onecx.permissions.application-id=${quarkus.application.name} quarkus.rest-client.onecx_document_svc.url = http://onecx-document-management-svc:8080 quarkus.openapi-generator.codegen.spec.onecx_document_management_svc_yaml.config-key=onecx_document_svc quarkus.openapi-generator.codegen.spec.onecx_document_management_svc_yaml.base-package=gen.org.tkit.onecx.document-management.client quarkus.openapi-generator.codegen.spec.onecx_document_management_svc_yaml.return-response=true quarkus.openapi-generator.codegen.input-base-dir=target/tmp/openapi quarkus.openapi-generator.codegen.spec.onecx_document_management_svc_yaml.additional-api-type-annotations=@org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.annotation.RegisterClientHeaders;

With OneCX-Document-Management Software, you can streamline your document management workflows, reduce manual efforts, and enhance productivity. Whether it’s managing contracts, invoices, legal documents, or any other form of digital content, OneCX Document Management provides a centralized and user-friendly solution for effectively managing your documents. === Overview OneCX-Document-Management is a comprehensive solution for managing documents in a user-friendly and efficient manner. It is a solution that consists of three main components which are explained in more detail in the general documentation. Please refer to the following documentation to learn more https://onecx.github.io/docs/document-management/current/general/index.html[Document-Management Documenation]. However, in this document we are only referring to one of the three components, the OneCX-Document-Management-Backend-For-Frontend (BFF) of OneCX-Document-Management. === What is a Backend For Frontend Backend For Frontend is an architectural pattern used in modern web development. The BFF pattern involves creating a dedicated backend service for each front-end client or application. This allows the backend to provide customised APIs and functionality optimised for the specific needs of each frontend. The code generation part of the `pom.xml` file is responsible for creating REST clients and proxies tailored to the backend services that the user interface needs to interact with. These clients and proxies act as the backend for the frontend, providing a dedicated and optimised interface for the document management frontend application. This architectural pattern provides a better separation of concerns, improves frontend performance and simplifies the frontend development process, as it only needs to deal with the APIs relevant to its functionality. The BFF pattern is particularly useful in microservices architectures, such as the OneCX workspaces, where different front-end clients may require different data and functionality from multiple back-end services. === Getting Started To start developing the OneCX Document Management BFF, you need to set up your local development environment. It’s recommended that you use WSL as the runtime for your application, as shown in the figure below. If you are using a different runtime, please check that you meet the requirements below. ==== Prerequisites Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: * Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 * Maven build tool * Git * Docker + Docker Compose (Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) recommended) ==== Clone the Repository Start by cloning the required repositories to your local machine using the following command: [source,bash] git clone https://github.com/onecx-apps/onecx-document-management-bff.git git clone https://github.com/onecx-apps/document-management-dev.git The repository `onecx-document-management-bff` contains the source code of the document management BFF. The repository `document-management-dev` contains the necessary OneCX platform dependencies and the docker-compose script required to run the OneCX Document-Management-User-Interface on your local machine. ==== Build the Project Navigate to the project directory and build the application using NPM: [source,bash] cd onecx-document-management-bff mvn clean install Downloading the required Maven dependencies for the first time may take some time. ==== Update local DNS resolution Assuming you are using WSL, updating the local host file for local development allows you to map domain names to specific IP addresses, making it easier to test and debug applications using custom domain names instead of IP addresses. To enable multiple services on the same port, we use traefik as a reverse proxy. A running traefik container is therefore essential for your local setup to route your traffic to the appropriate Docker containers based on hostnames. *It is recommended that the WSL host file and the Windows host file are aligned. Unless you have disabled this behaviour, the WSL host file will be automatically generated from the Windows host file when WSL is restarted.* ===== Update Windows host file Open the file `C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts` in your favorite editor and add the following entries: [source,bash] 127.0.0.1 pgadmin 127.0.0.1 postgresdb 127.0.0.1 keycloak-app 127.0.0.1 traefik 127.0.0.1 tkit-portal-app 127.0.0.1 tkit-portal-server 127.0.0.1 apm 127.0.0.1 wiremock 127.0.0.1 minio 127.0.0.1 onecx-document-management-ui 127.0.0.1 onecx-document-management-bff 127.0.0.1 onecx-document-management-svc ===== Update WSL host file If needed, update the file `\\etc\\hosts` in `your` favorite linux editor and add the same entries like above. ==== Starting OneCX dependencies In a local development environment, Docker Compose is used to define and manage multiple containers as a single application stack. It enables developers to easily start, stop, and configure all the necessary services and dependencies required by OneCX Document Management using a simple configuration file. [source,bash] cd document-management-dev docker compose up -d traefik postgresdb pgadmin keycloak-app tkit-portal-server minio apm * `traefik`: Traefik is an ingress controller for Kubernetes deployments that enables dynamic traffic routing and load balancing based on defined rules and configurations. * `postgresdb`: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system. It is used as persistence layer for storing and managing data in OneCX Document Management, providing reliability and scalability. * `pgadmin`: pgAdmin is an open-source administration and development platform that offers a user-friendly graphical interface for managing and interacting with the local PostgreSQL database. * `keycloak`: Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management system that simplifies authentication, authorization, and single sign-on for web and mobile applications. * `tkit-portal-server`: This micro-service is responsible mostly for handling the logic of portals and their meunitems and user data and settings. * `minio`: We use MinIO as a facade or abstraction layer to decouple our applications from the underlying cloud storage provider, providing greater flexibility and allowing us to seamlessly switch between different providers without changing our application code. It acts as a unified interface, enabling us to interact with various cloud storage systems using the standardized Amazon S3 API. * `apm`: In this backend, user permissions are stored in a structured manner and an endpoint is provided to import permissions via CSV files. Each application can be assigned a set of roles and permissions, managed through an association table in the APM database. Roles are assigned in the Keycloak admin console and are retrieved from tokens, while strings defined in APM are used to grant access to specific components or views on the frontend. ==== Starting the OneCX Document Management BFF The command `mvn compile quarkus:dev` is used in a Maven-based Quarkus project to compile the source code and start a live coding development mode. In this mode, Quarkus will automatically rebuild and redeploy the application whenever changes are detected in the source code, allowing for rapid development and testing. Please run: [source,bash] cd onecx-document-management-bff mvn compile quarkus:dev Commands Explained: * `mvn compile`: This command tells Maven to compile the source code of the project. It resolves dependencies, compiles the Java source files, and generates the compiled bytecode. * `quarkus:dev`: This is a Maven plugin goal provided by the Quarkus framework. It starts the Quarkus dev mode, which is a live coding mode for development. It launches your application in development mode, which includes features like hot-reloading and automatic recompilation. When you run mvn compile quarkus:dev, the build process compiles your application, and once it’s built, Quarkus starts a development server that listens for changes in the source code. If any changes are detected, the affected parts of the application are automatically recompiled and redeployed, allowing you to see the changes in real-time without restarting the application manually. ==== Stopping OneCX dependencies The `docker compose stop` command is used to stop the containers defined in a Docker Compose file. It gracefully stops the running containers by sending a stop signal, allowing them to perform any necessary cleanup tasks before shutting down.
